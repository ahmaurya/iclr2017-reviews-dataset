"Empirically, neural networks that attempt to learn programs from data have exhibited poor generalizability. Moreover, it has traditionally been difficult to reason about the behavior of these models beyond a certain level of input complexity. In order to address these issues, we propose augmenting neural architectures with a key abstraction: recursion. As an application, we implement recursion in the Neural Programmer-Interpreter framework on four tasks: grade-school addition, bubble sort, topological sort, and quicksort. We demonstrate superior generalizability and interpretability with small amounts of training data. Recursion divides the problem into smaller pieces and drastically reduces the domain of each neural network component, making it tractable to prove guarantees about the overall system’s behavior. Our experience suggests that in order for neural architectures to robustly learn program semantics, it is necessary to incorporate a concept like recursion.","jonathon@cs.berkeley.edu, ricshin@cs.berkeley.edu, dawnsong@cs.berkeley.edu","Jonathon Cai, Richard Shin, Dawn Song",berkeley.edu,Deep learning,BkbY4psgg,cai|making_neural_programming_architectures_generalize_via_recursion,Making Neural Programming Architectures Generalize via Recursion,,Accept (Oral),https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkbY4psgg&noteId=BkbY4psgg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BkbY4psgg
"We describe an image compression method, consisting of a nonlinear analysis transformation, a uniform quantizer, and a nonlinear synthesis transformation. The transforms are constructed in three successive stages of convolutional linear filters and nonlinear activation functions. Unlike most convolutional neural networks, the joint nonlinearity is chosen to implement a form of local gain control, inspired by those used to model biological neurons. Using a variant of stochastic gradient descent, we jointly optimize the entire model for rate-distortion performance over a database of training images, introducing a continuous proxy for the discontinuous loss function arising from the quantizer. Under certain conditions, the relaxed loss function may be interpreted as the log likelihood of a generative model, as implemented by a variational autoencoder. Unlike these models, however, the compression model must operate at any given point along the rate-distortion curve, as specified by a trade-off parameter. Across an independent set of test images, we find that the optimized method generally exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the standard JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression methods. More importantly, we observe a dramatic improvement in visual quality for all images at all bit rates, which is supported by objective quality estimates using MS-SSIM.","johannes.balle@nyu.edu, valero.laparra@uv.es, eero.simoncelli@nyu.edu","Johannes Ballé, Valero Laparra, Eero P.

"Though deep neural networks have shown great success in the large data domain, they generally perform poorly on few-shot learning tasks, where a model has to quickly generalize after seeing very few examples from each class. The general belief is that gradient-based optimization in high capacity models requires many iterative steps over many examples to perform well. Here, we propose an LSTM-based meta-learner model to learn the exact optimization algorithm used to train another learner neural network in the few-shot regime. The parametrization of our model allows it to learn appropriate parameter updates specifically for the scenario where a set amount of updates will be made, while also learning a general initialization of the learner network that allows for quick convergence of training. We demonstrate that this meta-learning model is competitive with deep metric-learning techniques for few-shot learning.","sachinr@twitter.com, hugo@twitter.com, sachinr@princeton.edu","Sachin Ravi, Hugo Larochelle","princeton.edu, twitter.com, umontreal.ca, google.com",,rJY0-Kcll,ravi|optimization_as_a_model_for_fewshot_learning,Optimization as a Model for Few-Shot Learning,We propose an LSTM-based meta-learner model to learn the exact optimization algorithm used to train another learner neural network in the few-shot regime,Accept (Oral),https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY0-Kcll&noteId=rJY0-Kcll,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJY0-Kcll
"Traditional dialog systems used in goal-oriented applications require a lot of domain-specific handcrafting, which hinders scaling up to new domains. End- to-end dialog systems, in which all components are trained from the dialogs themselves, escape this limitation. But the encouraging success recently obtained in chit-chat dialog may not carry over to goal-oriented settings. This paper proposes a testbed to break down the strengths and shortcomings of end-to-end dialog systems in goal-oriented applications. Set in the context of restaurant reservation, our tasks require manipulating sentences and symbols, so as to properly conduct conversations, issue API calls and use the outputs of such calls. We show that an end-to-end dialog system based on Memory Networks can reach promising, yet imperfect, performance and learn to perform non-trivial operations. We confirm those results by comparing our system to a hand-crafted slot-filling baseline on data from the second Dialog State Tracking Challenge (Henderson et al., 2014a). We show similar result patterns on data extracted from an online concierge service.","abordes@fb.com, ylan@fb.com, jase@fb.com","Antoine Bordes, Y-Lan Boureau, Jason Weston","google.com, cnrs.com",,S1Bb3D5gg,bordes|learning_endtoend_goaloriented_dialog,Learning End-to-End Goal-Oriented Dialog,A new open dataset and testbed for training and evaluating end-to-end dialog systems in goal-oriented scenarios.,Accept (Oral),https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg&noteId=S1Bb3D5gg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1Bb3D5gg
"The goal of this paper is not to introduce a single algorithm or method, but to make theoretical steps towards fully understanding the training dynamics of gen- erative adversarial networks. In order to substantiate our theoretical analysis, we perform targeted experiments to verify our assumptions, illustrate our claims, and quantify the phenomena. This paper is divided into three sections. The first sec- tion introduces the problem at hand. The second section is dedicated to studying and proving rigorously the problems including instability and saturation that arize when training generative adversarial networks.

"Deep reinforcement learning agents have achieved state-of-the-art results by directly maximising cumulative reward. However, environments contain a much wider variety of possible training signals. In this paper, we introduce an agent that also maximises many other pseudo-reward functions simultaneously by reinforcement learning. All of these tasks share a common representation that, like unsupervised learning, continues to develop in the absence of extrinsic rewards. We also introduce a novel mechanism for focusing this representation upon extrinsic rewards, so that learning can rapidly adapt to the most relevant aspects of the actual task. Our agent significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on Atari, averaging 880\% expert human performance, and a challenging suite of first-person, three-dimensional \emph{Labyrinth} tasks leading to a mean speedup in learning of 10$\times$ and averaging 87\% expert human performance on Labyrinth.","jaderberg@google.com, vmnih@google.com, lejlot@google.com, schaul@google.com, jzl@google.com, davidsilver@google.com, korayk@google.com","Max Jaderberg, Volodymyr Mnih, Wojciech Marian Czarnecki, Tom Schaul, Joel Z Leibo, David Silver, Koray Kavukcuoglu","google.com, ox.ac.uk, ucl.ac.uk",,SJ6yPD5xg,jaderberg|reinforcement_learning_with_unsupervised_auxiliary_tasks,Reinforcement Learning with Unsupervised Auxiliary Tasks,,Accept (Oral),https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ6yPD5xg&noteId=SJ6yPD5xg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJ6yPD5xg
"The current mainstream approach to train natural language systems is to expose them to large amounts of text. This passive learning is problematic if we are in- terested in developing interactive machines, such as conversational agents. We propose a framework for language learning that relies on multi-agent communi- cation. We study this learning in the context of referential games. In these games, a sender and a receiver see a pair of images. The sender is told one of them is the target and is allowed to send a message to the receiver, while the receiver must rely on it to identify the target. Thus, the agents develop their own language interactively out of the need to communicate. We show that two networks with simple configurations are able to learn to coordinate in the referential game. We further explore whether the “word meanings” induced in the game reflect intuitive semantic properties of the objects depicted in the image, and we present a simple strategy for grounding the agents’ code into natural language, a necessary step in developing machines that should eventually be able to communicate with humans.","angeliki.lazaridou@unitn.it, alexpeys@fb.com, marco.baroni@unitn.it","Angeliki Lazaridou, Alexander Peysakhovich, Marco Baroni","unitn.it, fb.com","Natural language processing, Reinforcement Learning, Games",Hk8N3Sclg,lazaridou|multiagent_cooperation_and_the_emergence_of_natural_language,Multi-Agent Cooperation and the Emergence of (Natural) Language,,Accept (Oral),https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg&noteId=Hk8N3Sclg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Hk8N3Sclg
"Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can
exhibit a remarkably small difference between training and test performance.
Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties
of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training.

Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional
approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in
practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art
convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic
gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This
phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs
even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We
corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction
showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite
sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the
number of data points as it usually does in practice.

We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.","chiyuan@mit.edu, bengio@google.com, mrtz@google.com, brecht@berkeley.edu, vinyals@google.com","Chiyuan Zhang, Samy Bengio, Moritz Hardt, Benjamin Recht, Oriol Vinyals","mit.edu, zju.edu.cn, google.com, berkeley.edu",Deep learning,Sy8gdB9xx,zhang|understanding_deep_learning_requires_rethinking_generalization,Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization,"Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how the traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice, and why understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization.",Accept (Oral),https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy8gdB9xx&noteId=Sy8gdB9xx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy8gdB9xx
"Neural networks are powerful and flexible models that work well for many difficult learning tasks in image, speech and natural language understanding. Despite their success, neural networks are still hard to design. In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.65, which is 0.09 percent better and 1.05x faster than the previous state-of-the-art model that used a similar architectural scheme. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines.  Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art model. The cell can also be transferred to the character language modeling task on PTB and achieves a state-of-the-art perplexity of 1.214.","barretzoph@google.com, qvl@google.com","Barret Zoph, Quoc Le",google.com,,r1Ue8Hcxg,zoph|neural_architecture_search_with_reinforcement_learning,Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning,,Accept (Oral),https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Ue8Hcxg&noteId=r1Ue8Hcxg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1Ue8Hcxg
"Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been successful in a wide variety of simulated domains. However, a major obstacle facing deep RL in the real world is their high sample complexity. Batch policy gradient methods offer stable learning, but at the cost of high variance, which often requires large batches. TD-style methods, such as off-policy actor-critic and Q-learning, are more sample-efficient but biased, and often require costly hyperparameter sweeps to stabilize. In this work, we aim to develop methods that combine the stability of policy gradients with the efficiency of off-policy RL. We present Q-Prop, a policy gradient method that uses a Taylor expansion of the off-policy critic as a control variate. Q-Prop is both sample efficient and stable, and effectively combines the benefits of on-policy and off-policy methods. We analyze the connection between Q-Prop and existing model-free algorithms, and use control variate theory to derive two variants of Q-Prop with conservative and aggressive adaptation. We show that conservative Q-Prop provides substantial gains in sample efficiency over trust region policy optimization (TRPO) with generalized advantage estimation (GAE), and improves stability over deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), the state-of-the-art on-policy and off-policy methods, on OpenAI Gym's MuJoCo continuous control environments.","sg717@cam.ac.uk, countzero@google.com, zoubin@eng.cam.ac.uk, ret26@cam.ac.uk, svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu","Shixiang Gu, Timothy Lillicrap, Zoubin Ghahramani, Richard E.

"We present an approach to sensorimotor control in immersive environments. Our approach utilizes a high-dimensional sensory stream and a lower-dimensional measurement stream. The cotemporal structure of these streams provides a rich supervisory signal, which enables training a sensorimotor control model by interacting with the environment. The model is trained using supervised learning techniques, but without extraneous supervision. It learns to act based on raw sensory input from a complex three-dimensional environment. The presented formulation enables learning without a fixed goal at training time, and pursuing dynamically changing goals at test time. We conduct extensive experiments in three-dimensional simulations based on the classical first-person game Doom. The results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms sophisticated prior formulations, particularly on challenging tasks. The results also show that trained models successfully generalize across environments and goals. A model trained using the presented approach won the Full Deathmatch track of the Visual Doom AI Competition, which was held in previously unseen environments.","adosovitskiy@gmail.com, vkoltun@gmail.com","Alexey Dosovitskiy, Vladlen Koltun","intel.com, cs.uni-freiburg.de, stanford.edu",,rJLS7qKel,dosovitskiy|learning_to_act_by_predicting_the_future,Learning to Act by Predicting the Future,We present an approach to sensorimotor control in immersive environments.,Accept (Oral),https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel&noteId=rJLS7qKel,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJLS7qKel
"The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method and its variants are algorithms of choice for many Deep Learning tasks. These methods operate in a small-batch regime wherein a fraction of the training data,  say $32$--$512$ data points, is sampled to compute an approximation to the gradient. It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a  degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions---and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation. We  discuss several  strategies to attempt to help large-batch methods eliminate this generalization gap.","keskar.nitish@u.northwestern.edu, dheevatsa.mudigere@intel.com, j-nocedal@northwestern.edu, mikhail.smelyanskiy@intel.com, peter.tang@intel.com","Nitish Shirish Keskar, Dheevatsa Mudigere, Jorge Nocedal, Mikhail Smelyanskiy, Ping Tak Peter Tang","northwestern.edu, intel.com, ibm.com","Deep learning, Optimization",H1oyRlYgg,keskar|on_largebatch_training_for_deep_learning_generalization_gap_and_sharp_minima,On Large-Batch Training for Deep Learning: Generalization Gap and Sharp Minima,"We present numerical evidence for the argument that if deep networks are trained using large (mini-)batches, they converge to sharp minimizers, and these minimizers have poor generalization properties.",Accept (Oral),https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oyRlYgg&noteId=H1oyRlYgg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H1oyRlYgg
"Some machine learning applications involve training data that is sensitive, such
as the medical histories of patients in a clinical trial. A model may
inadvertently and implicitly store some of its training data; careful analysis
of the model may therefore reveal sensitive information.

To address this problem, we demonstrate a generally applicable approach to
providing strong privacy guarantees for training data: Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE). The approach combines, in
a black-box fashion, multiple models trained with disjoint datasets, such as
records from different subsets of users. Because they rely directly on sensitive
data, these models are not published, but instead used as ''teachers'' for a ''student'' model. 
The student learns to predict an output chosen by noisy voting
among all of the teachers, and cannot directly access an individual teacher or
the underlying data or parameters. The student's privacy properties can be
understood both intuitively (since no single teacher and thus no single dataset
dictates the student's training) and formally, in terms of differential privacy.
 These properties hold even if an adversary can not only query the student but
also inspect its internal workings.

Compared with previous work, the approach imposes only weak assumptions on how
teachers are trained: it applies to any model, including non-convex models like
DNNs. We achieve state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs on MNIST and SVHN
thanks to an improved privacy analysis and semi-supervised learning.","ngp5056@cse.psu.edu, abadi@google.com, ulfar@google.com, ian@openai.com, kunal@google.com","Nicolas Papernot, Martín Abadi, Úlfar Erlingsson, Ian Goodfellow, Kunal Talwar","google.com, openai.com, psu.edu",,HkwoSDPgg,papernot|semisupervised_knowledge_transfer_for_deep_learning_from_private_training_data,Semi-supervised Knowledge Transfer for Deep Learning from Private Training Data,Semi-supervised learning of a privacy-preserving student model with GANs by knowledge transfer from an ensemble of teachers trained on partitions of private data.,Accept (Oral),https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg&noteId=HkwoSDPgg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HkwoSDPgg
"Image super-resolution (SR) is an underdetermined inverse problem, where a large number of plausible high resolution images can explain the same downsampled image. Most current single image SR methods use empirical risk minimisation, often with a pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss.
However, the outputs from such methods tend to be blurry, over-smoothed and generally appear implausible. A more desirable approach would employ Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference, preferring solutions that always have a high probability under the image prior, and thus appear more plausible. Direct MAP estimation for SR is non-trivial, as it requires us to build a model for the image prior from samples. Here we introduce new methods for \emph{amortised MAP inference} whereby we calculate the MAP estimate directly using a convolutional neural network. We first introduce a novel neural network architecture that performs a projection to the affine subspace of valid SR solutions ensuring that the high resolution output of the network is always consistent with the low resolution input. We show that, using this architecture, the amortised MAP inference problem reduces to minimising the cross-entropy between two distributions, similar to training generative models. We propose three methods to solve this optimisation problem: (1) Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) (2) denoiser-guided SR which backpropagates gradient-estimates from denoising to train the network, and (3) a baseline method using a maximum-likelihood-trained image prior. Our experiments show that the GAN based approach performs best on real image data. Lastly, we establish a connection between GANs and amortised variational inference as in e.g. variational autoencoders.","casperkaae@gmail.com, jcaballero@twitter.com, ltheis@twitter.com, wshi@twitter.com, fhuszar@twitter.com","Casper Kaae Sønderby, Jose Caballero, Lucas Theis, Wenzhe Shi, Ferenc Huszár","twitter.com, ku.dk, dtu.dk","Theory, Computer vision, Deep learning",S1RP6GLle,sønderby|amortised_map_inference_for_image_superresolution,Amortised MAP Inference for Image Super-resolution,Probabilisticly motivated image superresolution using a projection to the subspace of valid solutions,Accept (Oral),https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1RP6GLle&noteId=S1RP6GLle,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1RP6GLle

"Visual servoing involves choosing actions that move a robot in response to observations from a camera, in order to reach a goal configuration in the world. Standard visual servoing approaches typically rely on manually designed features and analytical dynamics models, which limits their generalization capability and often requires extensive application-specific feature and model engineering. In this work, we study how learned visual features, learned predictive dynamics models, and reinforcement learning can be combined to learn visual servoing mechanisms. We focus on target following, with the goal of designing algorithms that can learn a visual servo using low amounts of data of the target in question, to enable quick adaptation to new targets. Our approach is based on servoing the camera in the space of learned visual features, rather than image pixels or manually-designed keypoints. We demonstrate that standard deep features, in our case taken from a model trained for object classification, can be used together with a bilinear predictive model to learn an effective visual servo that is robust to visual variation, changes in viewing angle and appearance, and occlusions. A key component of our approach is to use a sample-efficient fitted Q-iteration algorithm to learn which features are best suited for the task at hand. We show that we can learn an effective visual servo on a complex synthetic car following benchmark using just 20 training trajectory samples for reinforcement learning. We demonstrate substantial improvement over a conventional approach based on image pixels or hand-designed keypoints, and we show an improvement in sample-efficiency of more than two orders of magnitude over standard model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

"Deep reinforcement learning has achieved many impressive results in recent years. However, tasks with sparse rewards or long horizons continue to pose significant challenges. To tackle these important problems, we propose a general framework that first learns useful skills in a pre-training environment, and then leverages the acquired skills for learning faster in downstream tasks.
Our approach brings together some of the strengths of intrinsic motivation and hierarchical methods: the learning of useful skill is guided by a single proxy reward, the design of which requires very minimal domain knowledge about the downstream tasks. Then a high-level policy is trained on top of these skills, providing a significant improvement of the exploration and allowing to tackle sparse rewards in the downstream tasks. To efficiently pre-train a large span of skills, we use Stochastic Neural Networks combined with an information-theoretic regularizer. Our experiments show that this combination is effective in learning a wide span of interpretable skills in a sample-efficient way, and can significantly boost the learning performance uniformly across a wide range of downstream tasks.","florensa@berkeley.edu, rocky@openai.com, pieter@openai.com","Carlos Florensa, Yan Duan, Pieter Abbeel","berkeley.edu, openai.com","Deep learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning",B1oK8aoxe,florensa|stochastic_neural_networks_for_hierarchical_reinforcement_learning,Stochastic Neural Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,"We propose a framework for learning a diverse set of skills using stochastic neural networks with minimum supervision, and utilize these skills in a hierarchical architecture to solve challenging tasks with sparse rewards",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1oK8aoxe&noteId=B1oK8aoxe,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1oK8aoxe
"Automatically determining the optimal size of a neural network for a given task without prior information currently requires an expensive global search and training many networks from scratch. In this paper, we address the problem of automatically finding a good network size during a single training cycle. We introduce {\it nonparametric neural networks}, a non-probabilistic framework for conducting optimization over all possible network sizes and prove its soundness when network growth is limited via an $\ell_p$ penalty. We train networks under this framework by continuously adding new units while eliminating redundant units via an $\ell_2$ penalty. We employ a novel optimization algorithm, which we term ``Adaptive Radial-Angular Gradient Descent'' or {\it AdaRad}, and obtain promising results.","george.philipp@email.de, jgc@cs.cmu.edu","George Philipp, Jaime G.

"As more computational resources become available, machine learning researchers train ever larger neural networks on millions of data points using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Although SGD scales well in terms of both the size of dataset and the number of parameters of the model, it has rapidly diminishing returns as parallel computing resources increase.  Second-order optimization methods have an affinity for well-estimated gradients and large mini-batches, and can therefore benefit much more from parallel computation in principle.   Unfortunately,  they often employ severe approximations to the curvature matrix in order to scale to large models with millions of parameters, limiting their effectiveness in practice versus well-tuned SGD with momentum.  The recently proposed K-FAC method(Martens and Grosse, 2015) uses a stronger and more sophisticated curvature approximation, and has been shown to make much more per-iteration progress than SGD, while only introducing a modest overhead.  In this paper, we develop a version of K-FAC that distributes the computation of gradients and additional quantities required by K-FAC across multiple machines, thereby taking advantage of method’s superior scaling to large mini-batches and mitigating its additional overheads.

"The success of CNNs in various applications is accompanied by a significant increase in the computation and parameter storage costs. Recent efforts toward reducing these overheads involve pruning and compressing the weights of various layers without hurting original accuracy.  However, magnitude-based pruning of weights reduces a significant number of parameters from the fully connected layers and may not adequately reduce the computation costs in the convolutional layers due to irregular sparsity in the pruned networks. We present an acceleration method for CNNs, where we prune filters from CNNs that are identified as having a small effect on the output accuracy. By removing whole filters in the network together with their connecting feature maps, the computation costs are reduced significantly. In contrast to pruning weights, this approach does not result in sparse connectivity patterns. Hence, it does not need the support of sparse convolution libraries and can work with existing efficient BLAS libraries for dense matrix multiplications. We show that even simple filter pruning techniques can reduce inference costs for VGG-16 by up to 34% and ResNet-110 by up to 38% on CIFAR10 while regaining close to the original accuracy by retraining the networks.","haoli@cs.umd.edu, asim@nec-labs.com, igord@nec-labs.com, hjs@cs.umd.edu, hpg@nec-labs.com","Hao Li, Asim Kadav, Igor Durdanovic, Hanan Samet, Hans Peter Graf","umd.edu, nec-labs.com, nervanasys.com","Computer vision, Deep learning",rJqFGTslg,li|pruning_filters_for_efficient_convnets,Pruning Filters for Efficient ConvNets,,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJqFGTslg&noteId=rJqFGTslg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJqFGTslg
"In this work, we investigate a novel training procedure to learn a generative model as the transition operator of a Markov chain, such that, when applied repeatedly on an unstructured random noise sample, it will denoise it into a sample that matches the target distribution from the training set. The novel training procedure to learn this progressive denoising operation involves sampling from a slightly different chain than the model chain used for generation in the absence of a denoising target. In the training chain we infuse information from the training target example that we would like the chains to reach with a high probability. The thus learned transition operator is able to produce quality and varied samples in a small number of steps.

"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful tools for classification of visual inputs. An important property of CNN is its restriction to local connections and sharing of local weights among different locations. In this paper, we consider the definition of appropriate local neighborhoods in CNN. We provide a theoretical analysis that justifies the traditional square filter used in CNN for analyzing natural images. The analysis also provides a principle for designing customized filter shapes for application domains that do not resemble natural images. We propose an approach that automatically designs multiple layers of different customized filter shapes by repeatedly solving lasso problems. It is applied to customize the filter shape for both bioacoustic applications and gene sequence analysis applications. In those domains with small sample sizes we demonstrate that the customized filters achieve superior classification accuracy, improved convergence behavior in training and reduced sensitivity to hyperparameters.","lixin@eecs.oregonstate.edu, lif@eecs.oregonstate.edu, xfern@eecs.oregonstate.edu, raich@eecs.oregonstate.edu","Xingyi Li, Fuxin Li, Xiaoli Fern, Raviv Raich",NA,,S1TER2oll,li|filter_shaping_for_convolutional_neural_networks,FILTER SHAPING FOR CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS,,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll&noteId=S1TER2oll,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1TER2oll
"Normalization techniques have only recently begun to be exploited in supervised learning tasks. Batch normalization exploits mini-batch statistics to normalize the activations. This was shown to speed up training and result in better models. However its success has been very limited when dealing with recurrent neural networks. On the other hand, layer normalization normalizes the activations across all activities within a layer. This was shown to work  well in the recurrent setting. In this paper we propose a unified view of  normalization techniques, as forms of divisive normalization, which includes layer and batch normalization as special cases. Our second contribution is the finding that a small modification to these normalization schemes, in conjunction with a sparse regularizer on the activations, leads to significant benefits over standard normalization techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified divisive normalization framework  in the context of convolutional neural nets and recurrent neural networks, showing  improvements over baselines in image classification, language modeling as well as super-resolution.","mren@cs.toronto.edu, rjliao@cs.toronto.edu, urtasun@cs.toronto.edu, fabian.sinz@epagoge.de, zemel@cs.toronto.edu","Mengye Ren, Renjie Liao, Raquel Urtasun, Fabian H.

"Developing accurate predictive models of sensory neurons is vital to understanding sensory processing and brain computations. The current standard approach to modeling neurons is to start with simple models and to incrementally add interpretable features. An alternative approach is to start with a more complex model that captures responses accurately, and then probe the fitted model structure to understand the neural computations. Here, we show that a multitask recurrent neural network (RNN) framework provides the flexibility necessary to model complex computations of neurons that cannot be captured by previous methods. Specifically, multilayer recurrent neural networks that share features across neurons outperform generalized linear models (GLMs) in predicting the spiking responses of parasol ganglion cells in the primate retina to natural images. The networks achieve good predictive performance given surprisingly small amounts of experimental training data. Additionally, we present a novel GLM-RNN hybrid model with separate spatial and temporal processing components which provides insights into the aspects of retinal processing better captured by the recurrent neural networks.","erb2180@columbia.edu, jsmerel@gmail.com, nbrack@stanford.edu, alexkenheitmen@gmail.com, sashake3@uscs.edu, Alan.Litke@cern.ch, ej@stanford.edu, liam@stat.columbia.edu","Eleanor Batty, Josh Merel, Nora Brackbill, Alexander Heitman, Alexander Sher, Alan Litke, E.J.

"People can learn a wide range of tasks from their own experience, but can also learn from observing other creatures. This can accelerate acquisition of new skills even when the observed agent differs substantially from the learning agent in terms of morphology. In this paper, we examine how reinforcement learning algorithms can transfer knowledge between morphologically different agents (e.g., different robots). We introduce a problem formulation where twp agents are tasked with learning multiple skills by sharing information. Our method uses the skills that were learned by both agents to train invariant feature spaces that can then be used to transfer other skills from one agent to another. The process of learning these invariant feature spaces can be viewed as a kind of ``analogy making,'' or implicit learning of partial correspondences between two distinct domains. We evaluate our transfer learning algorithm in two simulated robotic manipulation skills, and illustrate that we can transfer knowledge between simulated robotic arms with different numbers of links, as well as simulated arms with different actuation mechanisms, where one robot is torque-driven while the other is tendon-driven.","abhigupta@berkeley.edu, coline@berkeley.edu, yuxuanliu@berkeley.edu, pabbeel@cs.berkeley.edu, svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu","Abhishek Gupta, Coline Devin, YuXuan Liu, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine","cs.berkeley.edu, eecs.berkeley.edu, berkeley.edu, google.com","Deep learning, Reinforcement Learning, Transfer Learning",Hyq4yhile,gupta|learning_invariant_feature_spaces_to_transfer_skills_with_reinforcement_learning,Learning Invariant Feature Spaces to Transfer Skills with Reinforcement Learning,Learning a common feature space between robots with different morphology or actuation to transfer skills.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile&noteId=Hyq4yhile,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Hyq4yhile
"We develop a model of perceptual similarity judgment based on re-training a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) that learns to associate different views of each 3D object to capture the notion of object persistence and continuity in our visual experience. The re-training process effectively performs distance metric learning under the object persistency constraints, to modify the view-manifold of object representations. It reduces the effective distance between the representations of different views of the same object without compromising the distance between those of the views of different objects, resulting in the untangling of the view-manifolds between individual objects within the same category and across categories. This untangling enables the model to discriminate and recognize objects within the same category, independent of viewpoints. We found that this ability is not limited to the trained objects, but transfers to novel objects in both trained and untrained categories, as well as to a variety of completely novel artificial synthetic objects. This transfer in learning suggests the modification of distance metrics in view- manifolds is more general and abstract, likely at the levels of parts, and independent of the specific objects or categories experienced during training. Interestingly, the resulting transformation of feature representation in the deep networks is found to significantly better match human perceptual similarity judgment than AlexNet, suggesting that object persistence could be an important constraint in the development of perceptual similarity judgment in biological neural networks.","sean.linxingyu@pku.edu.cn, hao.wang@pku.edu.cn, zhihaol@andrew.cmu.edu, yimengzh@andrew.cmu.edu, alan.yuille@jhu.edu, tai@cnbc.cmu.edu","Xingyu Lin, Hao Wang, Zhihao Li, Yimeng Zhang, Alan Yuille, Tai Sing Lee","cmu.edu, pku.edu.cn, jhu.edu","Deep learning, Transfer Learning",B1gtu5ilg,lin|transfer_of_viewmanifold_learning_to_similarity_perception_of_novel_objects,Transfer of View-manifold Learning to Similarity Perception of Novel Objects,DCNN trained with multiple views of the same object can develop human-like perpetual similarity judgment that can transfer to novel objects,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1gtu5ilg&noteId=B1gtu5ilg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1gtu5ilg

We here address this question for the task of natural texture synthesis and show that none of the above aspects are indispensable. Instead, we demonstrate that natural textures of high perceptual quality can be generated from networks with only a single layer, no pooling and random filters.","ivan.ustyuzhaninov@bethgelab.org, wieland.brendel@bethgelab.org, leon.gatys@bethgelab.org, matthias.bethge@bethgelab.org","Ivan Ustyuzhaninov *, Wieland Brendel *, Leon Gatys, Matthias Bethge","bethgelab.org, uni-tuebingen.de","Deep learning, Unsupervised Learning",BJhZeLsxx,|what_does_it_take_to_generate_natural_textures,What does it take to generate natural textures?,"Natural textures of high perceptual quality can be generated from networks with only a single layer, no pooling and random filters.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx&noteId=BJhZeLsxx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJhZeLsxx

"A framework is presented for unsupervised learning of representations based on infomax principle for large-scale neural populations. We use an asymptotic approximation to the Shannon's mutual information for a large neural population to demonstrate that a good initial approximation to the global information-theoretic optimum can be obtained by a hierarchical infomax method. Starting from the initial solution, an efficient algorithm based on gradient descent of the final objective function is proposed to learn representations from the input datasets, and the method works for complete, overcomplete, and undercomplete bases. As confirmed by numerical experiments, our method is robust and highly efficient for extracting salient features from input datasets. Compared with the main existing methods, our algorithm has a distinct advantage in both the training speed and the robustness of unsupervised representation learning.

"Although Generative Adversarial Networks achieve state-of-the-art results on a
variety of generative tasks, they are regarded as highly unstable and prone to miss
modes. We argue that these bad behaviors of GANs are due to the very particular
functional shape of the trained discriminators in high dimensional spaces, which
can easily make training stuck or push probability mass in the wrong direction,
towards that of higher concentration than that of the data generating distribution.
We introduce several ways of regularizing the objective, which can dramatically
stabilize the training of GAN models. We also show that our regularizers can help
the fair distribution of probability mass across the modes of the data generating

"The past year saw the introduction of new architectures such as Highway networks and Residual networks which, for the first time, enabled the training of feedforward networks with dozens to hundreds of layers using simple gradient descent.
While depth of representation has been posited as a primary reason for their success, there are indications that these architectures defy a popular view of deep learning as a hierarchical computation of increasingly abstract features at each layer.

In this report, we argue that this view is incomplete and does not adequately explain several recent findings.
We propose an alternative viewpoint based on unrolled iterative estimation---a group of successive layers iteratively refine their estimates of the same features instead of computing an entirely new representation.
We demonstrate that this viewpoint directly leads to the construction of highway and residual networks.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) makes it possible to train agents capable of achieving
sophisticated goals in complex and uncertain environments. A key difficulty in
reinforcement learning is specifying a reward function for the agent to optimize.
Traditionally, imitation learning in RL has been used to overcome this problem.
Unfortunately, hitherto imitation learning methods tend to require that demonstrations
are supplied in the first-person: the agent is provided with a sequence of
states and a specification of the actions that it should have taken. While powerful,
this kind of imitation learning is limited by the relatively hard problem of collecting
first-person demonstrations. Humans address this problem by learning from
third-person demonstrations: they observe other humans perform tasks, infer the
task, and accomplish the same task themselves.
In this paper, we present a method for unsupervised third-person imitation learning.
Here third-person refers to training an agent to correctly achieve a simple
goal in a simple environment when it is provided a demonstration of a teacher
achieving the same goal but from a different viewpoint; and unsupervised refers
to the fact that the agent receives only these third-person demonstrations, and is
not provided a correspondence between teacher states and student states. Our
methods primary insight is that recent advances from domain confusion can be
utilized to yield domain agnostic features which are crucial during the training
process. To validate our approach, we report successful experiments on learning
from third-person demonstrations in a pointmass domain, a reacher domain, and
inverted pendulum.","bstadie@openai.com, pieter@openai.com, ilyasu@openai.com","Bradly C Stadie, Pieter Abbeel, Ilya Sutskever","openai.com, berkeley.edu, cs.berkeley.edu",,B16dGcqlx,stadie|third_person_imitation_learning,Third Person Imitation Learning,Agent watches another agent at a different camera angle completing the task and learns via raw pixels how to imitate.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx&noteId=B16dGcqlx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B16dGcqlx

Our experiments show that the precision of our model is comparable to that of neural networks while sharing a number of advantages with n-gram models such as fast query time and the capability to quickly add and remove training data samples.

We propose several scenarios that are challenging for reinforcement learning algorithms because the state- action space is very large, and there is no obvious feature representation for the value functions. We describe our approach to tackle the micromanagement scenarios with deep neural network controllers from raw state features given by the game engine. We also present a heuristic reinforcement learning algorithm which combines direct exploration in the policy space and backpropagation. This algorithm collects traces for learning using deterministic policies, which appears much more efficient than, e.g., ε-greedy exploration.

"The success of deep learning in numerous application domains created the desire to run and train them on mobile devices. This however, conflicts with their computationally, memory and energy intense nature, leading to a growing interest in compression.
Recent work by Han et al. (2016) propose a pipeline that involves retraining, pruning and quantization of neural network weights, obtaining state-of-the-art compression rates.
In this paper, we show that competitive compression rates can be achieved by using a version of ""soft weight-sharing"" (Nowlan & Hinton, 1991). Our method achieves both quantization and pruning in one simple (re-)training procedure. 
This point of view also exposes the relation between compression and the minimum description length (MDL) principle.","karen.ullrich@uva.nl, tmeeds@gmail.com, welling.max@gmail.com","Karen Ullrich, Edward Meeds, Max Welling",uva.nl,"Deep learning, Optimization",HJGwcKclx,ullrich|soft_weightsharing_for_neural_network_compression,Soft Weight-Sharing for Neural Network Compression,We use soft weight-sharing to compress neural network weights.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx&noteId=HJGwcKclx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJGwcKclx
"We propose the Neural Program Lattice (NPL), a neural network that learns to perform complex tasks by composing low-level programs to express high-level programs. Our starting point is the recent work on Neural Programmer-Interpreters (NPI), which can only learn from strong supervision that contains the whole hierarchy of low-level and high-level programs. NPLs remove this limitation by providing the ability to learn from weak supervision consisting only of sequences of low-level operations. We demonstrate the capability of NPL to learn to perform long-hand addition and arrange blocks in a grid-world environment. Experiments show that it performs on par with NPI while using weak supervision in place of most of the strong supervision, thus indicating its ability to infer the high-level program structure from examples containing only the low-level operations.","ctli@mit.edu, dtarlow@microsoft.com, algaunt@microsoft.com, mabrocks@microsoft.com, nkushman@microsoft.com","Chengtao Li, Daniel Tarlow, Alexander L.

"We introduce a new model, the Recurrent Entity Network (EntNet). It is equipped
with a dynamic long-term memory which allows it to maintain and update a rep-
resentation of the state of the world as it receives new data. For language under-
standing tasks, it can reason on-the-fly as it reads text, not just when it is required
to answer a question or respond as is the case for a Memory Network (Sukhbaatar
et al., 2015). Like a Neural Turing Machine or Differentiable Neural Computer
(Graves et al., 2014; 2016) it maintains a fixed size memory and can learn to
perform location and content-based read and write operations. However, unlike
those models it has a simple parallel architecture in which several memory loca-
tions can be updated simultaneously. The EntNet sets a new state-of-the-art on
the bAbI tasks, and is the first method to solve all the tasks in the 10k training
examples setting. We also demonstrate that it can solve a reasoning task which
requires a large number of supporting facts, which other methods are not able to
solve, and can generalize past its training horizon. It can also be practically used
on large scale datasets such as Children’s Book Test, where it obtains competitive
performance, reading the story in a single pass.","mbh305@nyu.edu, jase@fb.com, azslam@fb.com, abordes@fb.com, yann@fb.com","Mikael Henaff, Jason Weston, Arthur Szlam, Antoine Bordes, Yann LeCun","nyu.edu, fb.com","Natural language processing, Deep learning",rJTKKKqeg,henaff|tracking_the_world_state_with_recurrent_entity_networks,Tracking the World State with Recurrent Entity Networks,"A new memory-augmented model which learns to track the world state, obtaining SOTA on the bAbI tasks amongst other results.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg&noteId=rJTKKKqeg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJTKKKqeg
"It has long been recognized that the invariance and equivariance properties of a representation are critically important for success in many vision tasks. In this paper we present Steerable Convolutional Neural Networks, an efficient and flexible class of equivariant convolutional networks. We show that steerable CNNs achieve state of the art results on the CIFAR image classification benchmark. The mathematical theory of steerable representations reveals a type system in which any steerable representation is a composition of elementary feature types, each one associated with a particular kind of symmetry. We show how the parameter cost of a steerable filter bank depends on the types of the input and output features, and show how to use this knowledge to construct CNNs that utilize parameters effectively.","taco.cohen@gmail.com, m.welling@uva.nl","Taco S.

"A key goal of research in conversational systems is to train an interactive agent to help a user with a task. Human conversation, however, is notoriously incomplete, ambiguous, and full of extraneous detail. To operate effectively, the agent must not only understand what was explicitly conveyed but also be able to reason in the presence of missing or unclear information. When unable to resolve ambiguities on its own, the agent must be able to ask the user for the necessary clarifications and incorporate the response in its reasoning. Motivated by this problem we introduce QRAQ (""crack""; Query, Reason, and Answer Questions), a new synthetic domain, in which a User gives an Agent a short story and asks a challenge question. These problems are designed to test the reasoning and interaction capabilities of a learning-based Agent in a setting that requires multiple conversational turns. A good Agent should ask only non-deducible, relevant questions until it has enough information to correctly answer the User's question. We use standard and improved reinforcement learning based memory-network architectures to solve QRAQ problems in the difficult setting where the reward signal only tells the Agent if its final answer to the challenge question is correct or not. To provide an upper-bound to the RL results we also train the same architectures using supervised information that tells the Agent during training which variables to query and the answer to the challenge question. We evaluate our architectures on four QRAQ dataset types, and scale the complexity for each along multiple dimensions.","tklinger@us.ibm.com, guoxiao@umich.edu, cgbr@cs.umass.edu, jbigus@us.ibm.com, mcam@us.ibm.com, bkawas@us.ibm.com, krtalamad@us.ibm.com, gtesauro@us.ibm.com, baveja@umich.edu","Xiaoxiao Guo, Tim Klinger, Clemens Rosenbaum, Joseph P.

"While great strides have been made in using deep learning algorithms to solve supervised learning tasks, the problem of unsupervised learning - leveraging unlabeled examples to learn about the structure of a domain - remains a difficult unsolved challenge. Here, we explore prediction of future frames in a video sequence as an unsupervised learning rule for learning about the structure of the visual world. We describe a predictive neural network (""PredNet"") architecture that is inspired by the concept of ""predictive coding"" from the neuroscience literature. These networks learn to predict future frames in a video sequence, with each layer in the network making local predictions and only forwarding deviations from those predictions to subsequent network layers. We show that these networks are able to robustly learn to predict the movement of synthetic (rendered) objects, and that in doing so, the networks learn  internal representations that are useful for decoding latent object parameters (e.g. pose) that support object recognition with fewer training views. We also show that these networks can scale to complex natural image streams (car-mounted camera videos), capturing key aspects of both egocentric movement and the movement of objects in the visual scene, and the representation learned in this setting is useful for estimating the steering angle. These results suggest that prediction represents a powerful framework for unsupervised learning, allowing for implicit learning of object and scene structure.","lotter@fas.harvard.edu, gabriel.kreiman@tch.harvard.edu, davidcox@fas.harvard.edu","William Lotter, Gabriel Kreiman, David Cox",harvard.edu,,B1ewdt9xe,lotter|deep_predictive_coding_networks_for_video_prediction_and_unsupervised_learning,Deep Predictive Coding Networks for Video Prediction and Unsupervised Learning,,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ewdt9xe&noteId=B1ewdt9xe,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1ewdt9xe
"Learning tasks such as those involving genomic data often poses a serious challenge: the number of input features can be orders of magnitude larger than the number of training examples, making it difficult to avoid overfitting, even when using the known regularization techniques. We focus here on tasks in which the input is a description of the genetic variation specific to a patient, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), yielding millions of ternary inputs. Improving the ability of deep learning to handle such datasets could have an important impact in medical research, more specifically in precision medicine, where high-dimensional data regarding a particular patient is used to make predictions of interest. Even though the amount of data for such tasks is increasing, this mismatch between the number of examples and the number of inputs remains a concern. Naive implementations of classifier neural networks involve a huge number of free parameters in their first layer (number of input features times number of hidden units): each input feature is associated with as many parameters as there are hidden units. We propose a novel neural network parametrization which considerably reduces the number of free parameters. It is based on the idea that we can first learn or provide a distributed representation for each input feature (e.g. for each position in the genome where variations are observed in data), and then learn (with another neural network called the parameter prediction network) how to map a feature's distributed representation (based on the feature's identity not its value) to the vector of parameters specific to that feature in the classifier neural network (the weights which link the value of the feature to each of the hidden units). This approach views the problem of producing the parameters associated with each feature as a multi-task learning problem. We show experimentally on a population stratification task of interest to medical studies that the proposed approach can significantly reduce both the number of parameters and the error rate of the classifier.","adriana.romero.soriano@umontreal.ca, pierre-luc.carrier@umontreal.ca, akram.er-raqabi@umontreal.ca, Tristan.sylvain@umontreal.ca, alexis211@gmail.com, etiennedejoie@gmail.com, marc-andre.legault.1@umontreal.ca, julieh@well.ox.ac.uk, yoshua.umontreal@gmail.com","Adriana Romero, Pierre Luc Carrier, Akram Erraqabi, Tristan Sylvain, Alex Auvolat, Etienne Dejoie, Marc-André Legault, Marie-Pierre Dubé, Julie G.

Our model requires very few expensive autoregressive layers compared to PixelCNN and learns latent codes that are more compressed than a standard VAE while still capturing most non-trivial structure.

"Ensembles of neural networks are known to be much more robust and accurate than individual networks. However, training multiple deep networks for model averaging is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain the seemingly contradictory goal of ensembling multiple neural networks at no additional training cost. We achieve this goal by training a single neural network, converging to several local minima along its optimization path and saving the model parameters.  To obtain repeated rapid convergence, we leverage recent work on cyclic learning rate schedules. The resulting technique, which we refer to as Snapshot Ensembling, is simple, yet surprisingly effective.  We show in a series of experiments that our approach is compatible with diverse network architectures and learning tasks. It consistently yields  lower error rates than state-of-the-art single models at no additional training cost, and compares favorably with traditional network ensembles. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 our DenseNet Snapshot Ensembles obtain error rates of 3.4% and 17.4% respectively.","gh349@cornell.edu, yl2363@cornell.edu, geoff@cs.cornell.edu, liuzhuangthu@gmail.com, jeh@cs.cornell.edu, kqw4@cornell.edu","Gao Huang, Yixuan Li, Geoff Pleiss, Zhuang Liu, John E.

"Recent years have seen the proposal of a number of neural architectures for the problem of Program Induction. Given a set of input-output examples, these architectures are able to learn mappings that generalize to new test inputs. While achieving impressive results, these approaches have a number of important limitations: (a) they are computationally expensive and hard to train, (b) a model has to be trained for each task (program) separately, and (c) it is hard to interpret or verify the correctness of the learnt mapping (as it is defined by a neural network). In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis, to overcome the above-mentioned problems. Once trained, our approach can automatically construct computer programs in a domain-specific language that are consistent with a set of input-output examples provided at test time. Our method is based on two novel neural modules. The first module, called the cross correlation I/O network, given a set of input-output examples, produces a continuous representation of the set of I/O examples. The second module, the Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN), given the continuous representation of the examples, synthesizes a program by incrementally expanding partial programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the rich and complex domain of regular expression based string transformations. Experiments show that the R3NN model is not only able to construct programs from new input-output examples, but it is also able to construct new programs for tasks that it had never observed before during training.","eparisot@andrew.cmu.edu, asamir@microsoft.com, risin@microsoft.com, lihongli@microsoft.com, denzho@microsoft.com, pkohli@microsoft.com","Emilio Parisotto, Abdel-rahman Mohamed, Rishabh Singh, Lihong Li, Dengyong Zhou, Pushmeet Kohli","cmu.edu, microsoft.com","Deep learning, Structured prediction",rJ0JwFcex,parisotto|neurosymbolic_program_synthesis,Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis,A neural architecture for learning programs in a domain-specific language that are consistent with a given set of input-output examples,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex&noteId=rJ0JwFcex,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJ0JwFcex
"We propose a deep neural network for the prediction of future frames in natural video sequences. To effectively handle complex evolution of pixels in videos, we propose to decompose the motion and content, two key components generating dynamics in videos. Our model is built upon the Encoder-Decoder Convolutional Neural Network and Convolutional LSTM for pixel-level prediction, which independently capture the spatial layout of an image and the corresponding temporal dynamics. By independently modeling motion and content, predicting the next frame reduces to converting the extracted content features into the next frame content by the identified motion features, which simplifies the task of prediction. Our model is end-to-end trainable over multiple time steps, and naturally learns to decompose motion and content without separate training. We evaluate the pro- posed network architecture on human activity videos using KTH, Weizmann action, and UCF-101 datasets. We show state-of-the-art performance in comparison to recent approaches.

"An efficient learner is one who reuses what they already know to tackle a new problem. For a machine learner, this means understanding the similarities amongst datasets. In order to do this, one must take seriously the idea of working with datasets, rather than datapoints, as the key objects to model. Towards this goal, we demonstrate an extension of a variational autoencoder that can learn a method for computing representations, or statistics, of datasets in an unsupervised fashion. The network is trained to produce statistics that encapsulate a generative model for each dataset. Hence the network enables efficient learning from new datasets for both unsupervised and supervised tasks. We show that we are able to learn statistics that can be used for: clustering datasets, transferring generative models to new datasets, selecting representative samples of datasets and classifying previously unseen classes. We refer to our model as a neural statistician, and by this we mean a neural network that can learn to compute summary statistics of datasets without supervision.","h.l.edwards@sms.ed.ac.uk, amos.storkey@ed.ac.uk","Harrison Edwards, Amos Storkey","ed.ac.uk, openai.com",,HJDBUF5le,edwards|towards_a_neural_statistician,Towards a Neural Statistician,Learning representations of datasets with an extension of VAEs.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDBUF5le&noteId=HJDBUF5le,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJDBUF5le
"We propose a method to optimize the representation and distinguishability of samples from two probability distributions, by maximizing the estimated power of a statistical test based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). This optimized MMD is applied to the setting of unsupervised learning by generative adversarial networks (GAN), in which a model attempts to generate realistic samples, and a discriminator attempts to tell these apart from data samples. In this context, the MMD may be used in two roles: first, as a discriminator, either directly on the samples, or on features of the samples. Second, the MMD can be used to evaluate the performance of a generative model, by testing the model’s samples against a reference data set. In the latter role, the optimized MMD is particularly helpful, as it gives an interpretable indication of how the model and data distributions differ, even in cases where individual model samples are not easily distinguished either by eye or by classifier.","dougal@gmail.com, htung@cs.cmu.edu, heiko.strathmann@gmail.com, soumyajitde.cse@gmail.com, aramdas@berkeley.edu, alex@smola.org, arthur.gretton@gmail.com","Dougal J.

"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) can acquire complex behaviors from low-level inputs, such as images. However, real-world applications of such methods require generalizing to the vast variability of the real world. Deep networks are known to achieve remarkable generalization when provided with massive amounts of labeled data, but can we provide this breadth of experience to an RL agent, such as a robot? The robot might continuously learn as it explores the world around it, even while it is deployed and performing useful tasks. However, this learning requires access to a reward function, to tell the agent whether it is succeeding or failing at its task. Such reward functions are often hard to measure in the real world, especially in domains such as robotics and dialog systems, where the reward could depend on the unknown positions of objects or the emotional state of the user. On the other hand, it is often quite practical to provide the agent with reward functions in a limited set of situations, such as when a human supervisor is present, or in a controlled laboratory setting. Can we make use of this limited supervision, and still benefit from the breadth of experience an agent might collect in the unstructured real world? In this paper, we formalize this problem setting as semi-supervised reinforcement learning (SSRL), where the reward function can only be evaluated in a set of “labeled” MDPs, and the agent must generalize its behavior to the wide range of states it might encounter in a set of “unlabeled” MDPs, by using experience from both settings. Our proposed method infers the task objective in the unlabeled MDPs through an algorithm that resembles inverse RL, using the agent’s own prior experience in the labeled MDPs as a kind of demonstration of optimal behavior. We evaluate our method on challenging, continuous control tasks that require control directly from images, and show that our approach can improve the generalization of a learned deep neural network policy by using experience for which no reward function is available.

"Deep models have achieved great success on a variety of challenging tasks. How- ever, the models that achieve great performance often have an enormous number of parameters, leading to correspondingly great demands on both computational and memory resources, especially for fully-connected layers. In this work, we propose a new “density-diversity penalty” regularizer that can be applied to fully-connected layers of neural networks during training. We show that using this regularizer results in significantly fewer parameters (i.e., high sparsity), and also significantly fewer distinct values (i.e., low diversity), so that the trained weight matrices can be highly compressed without any appreciable loss in performance. The resulting trained models can hence reside on computational platforms (e.g., portables, Internet-of-Things devices) where it otherwise would be prohibitive.","wangsj@cs.washington.edu, haoran@uw.edu, bilmes@uw.edu, william-noble@u.washington.edu","Shengjie Wang, Haoran Cai, Jeff Bilmes, William Noble",washington.edu,Deep learning,Hku9NK5lx,wang|training_compressed_fullyconnected_networks_with_a_densitydiversity_penalty,Training Compressed Fully-Connected Networks with a Density-Diversity Penalty,"We propose a new ''density-diversity penalty'' to fully-connected layers to get significantly high sparsity and low diversity trained matrices, while keeping the performance the same.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hku9NK5lx&noteId=Hku9NK5lx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Hku9NK5lx
"Topic models are one of the most popular methods for learning representations of
text, but a major challenge is that any change to the topic model requires mathematically
deriving a new inference algorithm. A promising approach to address
this problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB), but it has proven diffi-
cult to apply to topic models in practice. We present what is to our knowledge the
first effective AEVB based inference method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA),
which we call Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic Model (AVITM). This
model tackles the problems caused for AEVB by the Dirichlet prior and by component
collapsing. We find that AVITM matches traditional methods in accuracy
with much better inference time. Indeed, because of the inference network, we
find that it is unnecessary to pay the computational cost of running variational
optimization on test data. Because AVITM is black box, it is readily applied
to new topic models. As a dramatic illustration of this, we present a new topic
model called ProdLDA, that replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product
of experts. By changing only one line of code from LDA, we find that ProdLDA
yields much more interpretable topics, even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs
sampling.","akash.srivastava@ed.ac.uk, csutton@inf.ed.ac.uk","Akash Srivastava, Charles Sutton",ed.ac.uk,"Deep learning, Unsupervised Learning, Applications, Optimization",BybtVK9lg,srivastava|autoencoding_variational_inference_for_topic_models,Autoencoding Variational Inference For Topic Models,We got autoencoding variational bayes to work for latent Dirichlet  allocation using one weird trick.

"We formulate learning of a binary autoencoder as a biconvex optimization problem which learns from the pairwise correlations between encoded and decoded bits. Among all possible algorithms that use this information, ours finds the autoencoder that reconstructs its inputs with worst-case optimal loss. The optimal decoder is a single layer of artificial neurons, emerging entirely from the minimax loss minimization, and with weights learned by convex optimization. All this is reflected in competitive experimental results, demonstrating that binary autoencoding can be done efficiently by conveying information in pairwise correlations in an optimal fashion.",abalsubr@stanford.edu,Akshay Balsubramani,"ucsd.edu, stanford.edu","Theory, Unsupervised Learning, Games",ryelgY5eg,balsubramani|optimal_binary_autoencoding_with_pairwise_correlations,Optimal Binary Autoencoding with Pairwise Correlations,"Efficient biconvex learning of binary autoencoders, using pairwise correlations between encodings and decodings, is strongly optimal.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg&noteId=ryelgY5eg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryelgY5eg
"The past several years have seen remarkable progress in generative models which produce convincing samples of images and other modalities. A shared component of some popular models such as generative adversarial networks and generative moment matching networks, is a decoder network, a parametric deep neural net that defines a generative distribution. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to quantify the performance of these models because of the intractability of log-likelihood estimation, and inspecting samples can be misleading. We propose to use Annealed Importance Sampling for evaluating log-likelihoods for decoder-based models and validate its accuracy using bidirectional Monte Carlo. Using this technique, we analyze the performance of decoder-based models, the effectiveness of existing log-likelihood estimators, the degree of overfitting, and the degree to which these models miss important modes of the data distribution.","ywu@cs.toronto.edu, yburda@openai.com, rsalakhu@cs.cmu.edu, rgrosse@cs.toronto.edu","Yuhuai Wu, Yuri Burda, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Roger Grosse","cs.toronto.edu, cs.cmu.edu, umontreal.ca, ttic.edu, openai.com","Deep learning, Unsupervised Learning",B1M8JF9xx,wu|on_the_quantitative_analysis_of_decoderbased_generative_models,On the Quantitative Analysis of Decoder-Based Generative Models,"We propose to use Annealed Importance Sampling to evaluate decoder-based generative network, and investigate various properties of these models.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx&noteId=B1M8JF9xx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1M8JF9xx
"Deep neural networks are widely used in machine learning applications. However, the deployment of large neural networks models can be difficult to deploy on mobile devices with limited power budgets. To solve this problem, we propose Trained Ternary Quantization (TTQ), a method that can reduce the precision of weights in neural networks to ternary values. This method has very little accuracy degradation and can even improve the accuracy of some models (32, 44, 56-layer ResNet) on CIFAR-10 and AlexNet on ImageNet. And our AlexNet model is trained from scratch, which means it’s as easy as to train normal full precision model. We highlight our trained quantization method that can learn both ternary values and ternary assignment. During inference, only ternary values (2-bit weights) and scaling factors are needed, therefore our models are nearly 16× smaller than full- precision models. Our ternary models can also be viewed as sparse binary weight networks, which can potentially be accelerated with custom circuit. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that the ternary models obtained by trained quantization method outperform full-precision models of ResNet-32,44,56 by 0.04%, 0.16%, 0.36%, respectively. On ImageNet, our model outperforms full-precision AlexNet model by 0.3% of Top-1 accuracy and outperforms previous ternary models by 3%.","zhucz13@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, songhan@stanford.edu, huizi@stanford.edu, dally@stanford.edu","Chenzhuo Zhu, Song Han, Huizi Mao, William J.

"Modern deep neural networks have a large number of parameters, making them very hard to train. We propose DSD, a dense-sparse-dense training flow, for regularizing deep neural networks and achieving better optimization performance. In the first D (Dense) step, we train a dense network to learn connection weights and importance. In the S (Sparse) step, we regularize the network by pruning the unimportant connections with small weights and retraining the network given the sparsity constraint. In the final D (re-Dense) step, we increase the model capacity by removing the sparsity constraint, re-initialize the pruned parameters from zero and retrain the whole dense network. Experiments show that DSD training can improve the performance for a wide range of CNNs, RNNs and LSTMs on the tasks of image classification, caption generation and speech recognition. On ImageNet, DSD improved the Top1 accuracy of GoogLeNet by 1.1%, VGG-16 by 4.3%, ResNet-18 by 1.2% and ResNet-50 by 1.1%, respectively. On the WSJ’93 dataset, DSD improved DeepSpeech and DeepSpeech2 WER by 2.0% and 1.1%. On the Flickr-8K dataset, DSD improved the NeuralTalk BLEU score by over 1.7. DSD is easy to use in practice: at training time, DSD incurs only one extra hyper-parameter: the sparsity ratio in the S step. At testing time, DSD doesn’t change the network architecture or incur any inference overhead. The consistent and significant performance gain of DSD experiments shows the inadequacy of the current training methods for finding the best local optimum, while DSD effectively achieves superior optimization performance for finding a better solution.

"We present the Neural Physics Engine (NPE), a framework for learning simulators of intuitive physics that naturally generalize across variable object count and different scene configurations. We propose a factorization of a physical scene into composable object-based representations and a neural network architecture whose compositional structure factorizes object dynamics into pairwise interactions. Like a symbolic physics engine, the NPE is endowed with generic notions of objects and their interactions; realized as a neural network, it can be trained via stochastic gradient descent to adapt to specific object properties and dynamics of different worlds. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on simple rigid body dynamics in two-dimensional worlds. By comparing to less structured architectures, we show that the NPE's compositional representation of the structure in physical interactions improves its ability to predict movement, generalize across variable object count and different scene configurations, and infer latent properties of objects such as mass.","mbchang@mit.edu, tomeru@mit.edu, torralba@mit.edu, jbt@mit.edu","Michael Chang, Tomer Ullman, Antonio Torralba, Joshua Tenenbaum",mit.edu,"Deep learning, Unsupervised Learning",Bkab5dqxe,chang|a_compositional_objectbased_approach_to_learning_physical_dynamics,A Compositional Object-Based Approach to Learning Physical Dynamics,We propose a factorization of a physical scene into composable object-based representations and also a model architecture whose compositional structure factorizes object dynamics into pairwise interactions.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkab5dqxe&noteId=Bkab5dqxe,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Bkab5dqxe
"Despite recent advances, memory-augmented deep neural networks are still limited

thus scales to large memory sizes.
Except for the nearest-neighbor query, the module is fully differentiable

a life-long manner, i.e., without the need to reset it during training.

Our memory module can be easily added to any part of a supervised neural network.

"Recent papers have shown that neural networks obtain state-of-the-art performance on several different sequence tagging tasks. One appealing property of such systems is their generality, as excellent performance can be achieved with a unified architecture and without task-specific feature engineering.  However, it is unclear if such systems can be used for tasks without large amounts of training data. In this paper we explore the problem of transfer learning for neural sequence taggers, where a source task with plentiful annotations (e.g., POS tagging on Penn Treebank) is used to improve performance on a target task with fewer available annotations (e.g., POS tagging for microblogs). We examine the effects of transfer learning for deep hierarchical recurrent networks across domains, applications, and languages, and show that significant improvement can often be obtained.  These improvements lead to improvements over the current state-of-the-art on several well-studied tasks.","zhiliny@cs.cmu.edu, rsalakhu@cs.cmu.edu, wcohen@cs.cmu.edu","Zhilin Yang, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, William W.

"The success of neural network methods for computing word embeddings has motivated methods for generating semantic embeddings of longer pieces of text, such as sentences and paragraphs. Surprisingly, Wieting et al (ICLR'16) showed that such complicated methods are outperformed, especially in out-of-domain (transfer learning) settings, by simpler methods involving mild retraining of word embeddings and basic linear regression. The  method of Wieting et al. requires retraining with a substantial labeled dataset such as Paraphrase Database (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013). 

The current paper goes further, showing that the following completely unsupervised sentence embedding is a formidable baseline: Use word embeddings computed using one of the popular methods on unlabeled corpus like Wikipedia, represent the sentence by a weighted average of the word vectors, and then modify them a bit using PCA/SVD. This weighting improves performance by about 10% to 30% in textual similarity tasks, and beats sophisticated supervised methods including RNN's and LSTM's. It even improves Wieting et al.'s embeddings. 
 This simple method should be used as the baseline to beat in future, especially when labeled training data is scarce or nonexistent. 

The paper also gives a theoretical explanation of the success of the above unsupervised method using a latent variable generative model for sentences, which is a simple extension of the model in Arora et al. (TACL'16) with new ""smoothing"" terms that allow for 
words occurring out of context, as well as high probabilities for words like and, not in all contexts.","arora@cs.princeton.edu, yingyul@cs.princeton.edu, tengyu@cs.princeton.edu","Sanjeev Arora, Yingyu Liang, Tengyu Ma",cs.princeton.edu,"Natural language processing, Unsupervised Learning",SyK00v5xx,arora|a_simple_but_toughtobeat_baseline_for_sentence_embeddings,A Simple but Tough-to-Beat Baseline for Sentence Embeddings,A simple unsupervised method for sentence embedding that can get results comparable to sophisticated models like RNN's and LSTM's,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyK00v5xx&noteId=SyK00v5xx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyK00v5xx
"Two potential bottlenecks on the expressiveness of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are their ability to store information about the task in their parameters, and to store information about the input history in their units. We show experimentally that all common RNN architectures achieve nearly the same per-task and per-unit capacity bounds with careful training, for a variety of tasks and stacking depths. They can store an amount of task information which is linear in the number of parameters, and is approximately 5 bits per parameter. They can additionally store approximately one real number from their input history per hidden unit. We further find that for several tasks it is the per-task parameter capacity bound that determines performance. These results suggest that many previous results comparing RNN architectures are driven primarily by differences in training effectiveness, rather than differences in capacity. Supporting this observation, we compare training difficulty for several architectures, and show that vanilla RNNs are far more difficult to train, yet have slightly higher capacity. Finally, we propose two novel RNN architectures, one of which is easier to train than the LSTM or GRU for deeply stacked architectures.","jlcollins@google.com, jaschasd@google.com, sussillo@google.com","Jasmine Collins, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, David Sussillo",google.com,Deep learning,BydARw9ex,collins|capacity_and_trainability_in_recurrent_neural_networks,Capacity and Trainability in Recurrent Neural Networks,,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex&noteId=BydARw9ex,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BydARw9ex
"When encountering novel objects, humans are able to infer a wide range of physical properties such as mass, friction and deformability by interacting with them in a goal driven way. This process of active interaction is in the same spirit as a scientist performing experiments to discover hidden facts. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have yielded machines that can achieve superhuman performance in Go, Atari, natural language processing, and complex control problems; however, it is not clear that these systems can rival the scientific intuition of even a young child. In this work we introduce a basic set of tasks that require agents to estimate properties such as mass and cohesion of objects in an interactive simulated environment where they can manipulate the objects and observe the consequences. We found that deep reinforcement learning methods can learn to perform the experiments necessary to discover such hidden properties. By systematically manipulating the problem difficulty and the cost incurred by the agent for performing experiments, we found that agents learn different strategies that balance the cost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes in different situations.  We also compare our learned experimentation policies to randomized baselines and show that the learned policies lead to better predictions.","mdenil@google.com, pulkitag@berkeley.edu, tkulkarni@google.com, etom@google.com, peterbattaglia@google.com, nandodefreitas@google.com","Misha Denil, Pulkit Agrawal, Tejas D Kulkarni, Tom Erez, Peter Battaglia, Nando de Freitas","google.com, berkeley.edu","Deep learning, Reinforcement Learning",r1nTpv9eg,denil|learning_to_perform_physics_experiments_via_deep_reinforcement_learning,Learning to Perform Physics Experiments via Deep Reinforcement Learning,We train agents to conduct experiments in interactive simulated physical environments.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1nTpv9eg&noteId=r1nTpv9eg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1nTpv9eg
"This paper presents a novel form of policy gradient for model-free reinforcement learning (RL) with improved exploration properties. Current policy-based methods use entropy regularization to encourage undirected exploration of the reward landscape, which is ineffective in high dimensional spaces with sparse rewards. We propose a more directed exploration strategy that promotes exploration of under-appreciated reward regions. An action sequence is considered under-appreciated if its log-probability under the current policy under-estimates its resulting reward. The proposed exploration strategy is easy to implement, requiring only small modifications to the standard REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the approach on a set of algorithmic tasks that have long challenged RL methods. We find that our approach reduces hyper-parameter sensitivity and demonstrates significant improvements over baseline methods. Notably, the approach is able to solve a benchmark multi-digit addition task. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a pure RL method has solved addition using only reward feedback.","ofirnachum@google.com, mnorouzi@google.com, schuurmans@google.com","Ofir Nachum, Mohammad Norouzi, Dale Schuurmans","google.com, ualberta.ca",Reinforcement Learning,ryT4pvqll,nachum|improving_policy_gradient_by_exploring_underappreciated_rewards,Improving Policy Gradient by Exploring Under-appreciated Rewards,We present a novel form of policy gradient for model-free reinforcement learning with improved exploration properties.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT4pvqll&noteId=ryT4pvqll,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryT4pvqll
"Neural networks that compute over graph structures are a natural fit for problems in a variety of domains, including natural language (parse trees) and cheminformatics (molecular graphs). However, since the computation graph has a different shape and size for every input, such networks do not directly support batched training or inference. They are also difficult to implement in popular deep learning libraries, which are based on static data-flow graphs. We introduce a technique called dynamic batching, which not only batches together operations between different input graphs of dissimilar shape, but also between different nodes within a single input graph. The technique allows us to create static graphs, using popular libraries, that emulate dynamic computation graphs of arbitrary shape and size. We further present a high-level library of compositional blocks that simplifies the creation of dynamic graph models.

We focus on transfer learning, where large pretrained networks are adapted to specialized tasks. The proposed criterion demonstrates superior performance compared to other criteria, e.g. the norm of kernel weights or feature map activation, for pruning large CNNs after adaptation to fine-grained classification tasks (Birds-200 and Flowers-102) relaying only on the first order gradient information.

New architectures are handcrafted by careful experimentation or modified from a handful of existing networks. We introduce MetaQNN, a meta-modeling algorithm based on reinforcement learning to automatically generate high-performing CNN architectures for a given learning task. The learning agent is trained to sequentially choose CNN layers using $Q$-learning with an $\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay. The agent explores a large but finite space of possible architectures and iteratively discovers designs with improved performance on the learning task. On image classification benchmarks, the agent-designed networks (consisting of only standard convolution, pooling, and fully-connected layers) beat existing networks designed with the same layer types and are competitive against the state-of-the-art methods that use more complex layer types.

"Machine comprehension of text is an important problem in natural language processing. A recently released dataset, the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), offers a large number of real questions and their answers created by humans through crowdsourcing. SQuAD provides a challenging testbed for evaluating machine comprehension algorithms, partly because compared with previous datasets, in SQuAD the answers do not come from a small set of candidate answers and they have variable lengths. We propose an end-to-end neural architecture for the task. The architecture is based on match-LSTM, a model we proposed previously for textual entailment, and Pointer Net, a sequence-to-sequence model proposed by Vinyals et al.

"In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) has found great success in domains such as multimedia understanding. However, the complex nature of multimedia data makes it difficult to develop DL-based software. The state-of-the-art tools, such as Caffe, TensorFlow, Torch7, and CNTK, while are successful in their applicable domains, are programming libraries with fixed user interface, internal representation, and execution environment. This makes it difficult to implement portable and customized DL applications.

In this paper, we present DeepDSL, a domain specific language (DSL) embedded in Scala, that compiles deep networks written in DeepDSL to Java source code. Deep DSL provides 

(1) intuitive constructs to support compact encoding of deep networks; 
(2) symbolic gradient derivation of the networks; 
(3) static analysis for memory consumption and error detection; and 
(4) DSL-level optimization to improve memory and runtime efficiency. 

DeepDSL programs are compiled into compact, efficient, customizable, and portable Java source code, which operates the CUDA and CUDNN interfaces running on NVIDIA GPU via a Java Native Interface (JNI) library. We evaluated DeepDSL with a number of popular DL networks. Our experiments show that the compiled programs have very competitive runtime performance and memory efficiency compared to the existing libraries.","tzhao@uwm.edu, xiaobing@uwm.edu, ycao@cs.uml.edu","Tian Zhao, Xiao Bing Huang, Yu Cao","uwm.edu, cs.uml.edu, fresnostate.edu, utc.edu","Deep learning, Applications, Optimization",Bks8cPcxe,zhao|deepdsl_a_compilationbased_domainspecific_language_for_deep_learning,DeepDSL: A Compilation-based Domain-Specific Language for Deep Learning,"DeepDSL(a DSL embedded in Scala) that compiles deep learning networks written in DeepDSL to Java source code, which runs on any GPU equipped machines with competitive efficiency as existing state-of-the-art tools (e.g. Caffe and Tensorflow)",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe&noteId=Bks8cPcxe,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Bks8cPcxe
"Machine comprehension (MC), answering a query about a given context paragraph, requires modeling complex interactions between the context and the query. Recently, attention mechanisms have been successfully extended to MC. Typically these methods use attention to focus on a small portion of the context and summarize it with a fixed-size vector, couple attentions temporally, and/or often form a uni-directional attention. In this paper we introduce the Bi-Directional Attention Flow (BIDAF) network, a multi-stage hierarchical process that represents the context at different levels of granularity and uses bi-directional attention flow mechanism to obtain a query-aware context representation without early summarization.

"Several deep learning models have been proposed for question answering. How- ever, due to their single-pass nature, they have no way to recover from local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. To address this problem, we introduce the Dynamic Coattention Network (DCN) for question answering. The DCN first fuses co-dependent representations of the question and the document in order to focus on relevant parts of both. Then a dynamic pointer decoder iterates over potential answer spans. This iterative procedure enables the model to recover from initial local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. On the Stanford question answering dataset, a single DCN model improves the previous state of the art from 71.0% F1 to 75.9%, while a DCN ensemble obtains 80.4% F1.","cxiong@salesforce.com, vzhong@salesforce.com, rsocher@salesforce.com","Caiming Xiong, Victor Zhong, Richard Socher","salesforce.com, metamind.io","Natural language processing, Deep learning, Applications",rJeKjwvclx,xiong|dynamic_coattention_networks_for_question_answering,Dynamic Coattention Networks For Question Answering,An end-to-end dynamic neural network model for question answering that achieves the state of the art and best leaderboard performance on the Stanford QA dataset.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx&noteId=rJeKjwvclx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJeKjwvclx

"Many machine learning systems are built to solve the hardest examples of a particular task, which often makes them large and expensive to run---especially with respect to the easier examples, which might require much less computation. For an agent with a limited computational budget, this ""one-size-fits-all"" approach may result in the agent wasting valuable computation on easy examples, while not spending enough on hard examples. Rather than learning a single, fixed policy for solving all instances of a task, we introduce a metacontroller which learns to optimize a sequence of ""imagined"" internal simulations over predictive models of the world in order to construct a more informed, and more economical, solution. The metacontroller component is a model-free reinforcement learning agent, which decides both how many iterations of the optimization procedure to run, as well as which model to consult on each iteration. The models (which we call ""experts"") can be state transition models, action-value functions, or any other mechanism that provides information useful for solving the task, and can be learned on-policy or off-policy in parallel with the metacontroller. When the metacontroller, controller, and experts were trained with ""interaction networks"" (Battaglia et al., 2016) as expert models, our approach was able to solve a challenging decision-making problem under complex non-linear dynamics. The metacontroller learned to adapt the amount of computation it performed to the difficulty of the task, and learned how to choose which experts to consult by factoring in both their reliability and individual computational resource costs. This allowed the metacontroller to achieve a lower overall cost (task loss plus computational cost) than more traditional fixed policy approaches. These results demonstrate that our approach is a powerful framework for using rich forward models for efficient model-based reinforcement learning.","jhamrick@berkeley.edu, aybd@google.com, razp@google.com, vinyals@google.com, heess@google.com, peterbattaglia@google.com","Jessica B.

"Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are widely used to solve a variety of problems and as the quantity of data and the amount of available compute have increased, so have model sizes. The number of parameters in recent state-of-the-art networks makes them hard to deploy, especially on mobile phones and embedded devices. The challenge is due to both the size of the model and the time it takes to evaluate it. In order to deploy these RNNs efficiently, we propose a technique to reduce the parameters of a network by pruning weights during the initial training of the network. At the end of training, the parameters of the network are sparse while accuracy is still close to the original dense neural network. The network size is reduced by 8× and the time required to train the model remains constant. Additionally, we can prune a larger dense network to achieve better than baseline performance while still reducing the total number of parameters significantly. Pruning RNNs reduces the size of the model and can also help achieve significant inference time speed-up using sparse GEMMs. Benchmarks show that using our technique model size can be reduced by 90% and speed-up is around 2× to 7×.","sharan@baidu.com, gdiamos@baidu.com, ssengupta@baidu.com, eriche@google.com","Sharan Narang, Greg Diamos, Shubho Sengupta, Erich Elsen","google.com, baidu.com","Speech, Deep learning, Supervised Learning",BylSPv9gx,narang|exploring_sparsity_in_recurrent_neural_networks,Exploring Sparsity in Recurrent Neural Networks,Reduce parameter count in recurrent neural networks to create smaller models for faster deployment,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylSPv9gx&noteId=BylSPv9gx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BylSPv9gx
"We propose a new approach to the problem of optimizing autoencoders for lossy image compression. New media formats, changing hardware technology, as well as diverse requirements and content types create a need for compression algorithms which are more flexible than existing codecs. Autoencoders have the potential to address this need, but are difficult to optimize directly due to the inherent non-differentiabilty of the compression loss. We here show that minimal changes to the loss are sufficient to train deep autoencoders competitive with JPEG 2000 and outperforming recently proposed approaches based on RNNs. Our network is furthermore computationally efficient thanks to a sub-pixel architecture, which makes it suitable for high-resolution images. This is in contrast to previous work on autoencoders for compression using coarser approximations, shallower architectures, computationally expensive methods, or focusing on small images.","ltheis@twitter.com, wshi@twitter.com, acunningham@twitter.com, fhuszar@twitter.com","Lucas Theis, Wenzhe Shi, Andrew Cunningham, Ferenc Huszár","twitter.com, bethgelab.org","Computer vision, Deep learning, Applications",rJiNwv9gg,theis|lossy_image_compression_with_compressive_autoencoders,Lossy Image Compression with Compressive Autoencoders,A simple approach to train autoencoders to compress images as well or better than JPEG 2000.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJiNwv9gg&noteId=rJiNwv9gg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJiNwv9gg
"Attention networks have proven to be an effective approach for embedding categorical inference within a deep neural network. However, for many tasks we may want to model richer structural dependencies without abandoning end-to-end training. In this work, we experiment with incorporating richer structural distributions, encoded using graphical models, within deep networks. We show that these structured attention networks are simple extensions of the basic attention procedure, and that they allow for extending attention  beyond the standard soft-selection approach, such as attending to partial segmentations or to subtrees. We experiment with two different classes of structured attention networks: a linear-chain conditional random field and a graph-based parsing model, and describe how these models can be practically implemented as neural network layers. Experiments show that this approach is effective for incorporating structural biases, and structured attention networks outperform baseline attention models on a variety of synthetic and real tasks: tree transduction, neural machine translation, question answering, and natural language inference. We further find that models trained in this way learn interesting unsupervised hidden representations that generalize simple attention.","yoonkim@seas.harvard.edu, carldenton@college.harvard.edu, lhoang@g.harvard.edu, srush@seas.harvard.edu","Yoon Kim, Carl Denton, Luong Hoang, Alexander M.

"We propose zoneout, a novel method for regularizing RNNs.

But by preserving instead of dropping hidden units, gradient information and state information are more readily propagated through time, as in feedforward stochastic depth networks.
We perform an empirical investigation of various RNN regularizers, and find that zoneout gives significant performance improvements across tasks. We achieve competitive results with relatively simple models in character- and word-level language modelling on the Penn Treebank and Text8 datasets, and combining with recurrent batch normalization yields state-of-the-art results on permuted sequential MNIST.","davidscottkrueger@gmail.com, tegan.jrm@gmail.com, ballas.n@gmail.com","David Krueger, Tegan Maharaj, Janos Kramar, Mohammad Pezeshki, Nicolas Ballas, Nan Rosemary Ke, Anirudh  Goyal, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, Christopher Pal",umontreal.ca,Deep learning,rJqBEPcxe,krueger|zoneout_regularizing_rnns_by_randomly_preserving_hidden_activations,Zoneout: Regularizing RNNs by Randomly Preserving Hidden Activations,Zoneout is like dropout (for RNNs) but uses identity masks instead of zero masks,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJqBEPcxe&noteId=rJqBEPcxe,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJqBEPcxe
"We propose Edward, a Turing-complete probabilistic programming language. Edward defines two compositional representations—random variables and inference. By treating inference as a first class citizen, on a par with modeling, we show that probabilistic programming can be as flexible and computationally efficient as traditional deep learning. For flexibility, Edward makes it easy to fit the same model using a variety of composable inference methods, ranging from point estimation to variational inference to MCMC. In addition, Edward can reuse the modeling representation as part of inference, facilitating the design of rich variational models and generative adversarial networks. For efficiency, Edward is integrated into TensorFlow, providing significant speedups over existing probabilistic systems. For example, we show on a benchmark logistic regression task that Edward is at least 35x faster than Stan and 6x faster than PyMC3. Further, Edward incurs no runtime overhead: it is as fast as handwritten TensorFlow.","dustin@cs.columbia.edu, mathoffm@adobe.com, rif@google.com, ebrevdo@google.com, kpmurphy@google.com, david.blei@columbia.edu","Dustin Tran, Matthew D.

"Representation learning seeks to expose certain aspects of observed data in a learned representation that's amenable to downstream tasks like classification. 
For instance, a good representation for 2D images might be one that describes only global structure and discards information about detailed texture. 
In this paper, we present a simple but principled method to learn such global representations by combining Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with neural autoregressive models such as RNN, MADE and PixelRNN/CNN. 
Our proposed VAE model allows us to have control over what the global latent code can learn and , by designing the architecture accordingly, we can force the global latent code to discard irrelevant information such as texture in 2D images, and hence the code only ``autoencodes'' data in a lossy fashion.
In addition, by leveraging autoregressive models as both prior distribution $p(z)$ and decoding distribution $p(x|z)$, we can greatly improve generative modeling performance of VAEs, achieving new state-of-the-art results on MNIST, OMNIGLOT and Caltech-101 as well as competitive results on CIFAR10.","peter@openai.com, dpkingma@openai.com, tim@openai.com, rocky@openai.com, prafulla@mit.edu, joschu@openai.com, ilyasu@openai.com, pieter@openai.com","Xi Chen, Diederik P.

"The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by its number of parameters.  Conditional computation, where parts of the network are active on a per-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation.  In practice, however, there are significant algorithmic and performance challenges.  In this work, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation, achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters.  We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks.  A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example.

The topology of the tree is explicitly modeled, allowing the network to predict both content and topology of the tree when decoding. That is, given only an encoded vector representation, the network is able to simultaneously generate a tree from it and predict labels for the nodes. We test this architecture in an encoder-decoder framework, where we train a network to encode a sentence as a vector, and then generate a tree structure from it. The experimental results show the effectiveness of this architecture at recovering latent tree structure in sequences and at mapping sentences to simple functional programs.","dalvmel@mit.edu, tommi@csail.mit.edu","David Alvarez-Melis, Tommi S.

"External neural memory structures have recently become a popular tool for

  for the neural setting.  In this paradigm, memory is accessed using
  a continuous head in a key-space manifold. The head is moved via Lie
  group actions, such as shifts or rotations, generated by a
  controller, and memory access is performed by linear smoothing in
  key space. We argue that Lie groups provide a natural generalization

  provide inverse and identity operators while maintaining
  differentiability. To experiment with this approach, we implement

"Recurrent neural networks are a powerful tool for modeling sequential data, but the dependence of each timestep’s computation on the previous timestep’s output limits parallelism and makes RNNs unwieldy for very long sequences. We introduce quasi-recurrent neural networks (QRNNs), an approach to neural sequence modeling that alternates convolutional layers, which apply in parallel across timesteps, and a minimalist recurrent pooling function that applies in parallel across channels. Despite lacking trainable recurrent layers, stacked QRNNs have better predictive accuracy than stacked LSTMs of the same hidden size. Due to their increased parallelism, they are up to 16 times faster at train and test time. Experiments on language modeling, sentiment classification, and character-level neural machine translation demonstrate these advantages and underline the viability of QRNNs as a basic building block for a variety of sequence tasks.","james.bradbury@salesforce.com, smerity@salesforce.com, cxiong@salesforce.com, rsocher@salesforce.com","James Bradbury, Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, Richard Socher",salesforce.com,"Natural language processing, Deep learning",H1zJ-v5xl,bradbury|quasirecurrent_neural_networks,Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks,"QRNNs, composed of convolutions and a recurrent pooling function, outperform LSTMs on a variety of sequence tasks and are up to 16 times faster.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl&noteId=H1zJ-v5xl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H1zJ-v5xl

"Sample complexity and safety are major challenges when learning policies with reinforcement learning for real-world tasks, especially when the policies are represented using rich function approximators like deep neural networks. Model-based methods where the real-world target domain is approximated using a simulated source domain provide an avenue to tackle the above challenges by augmenting real data with simulated data. However, discrepancies between the simulated source domain and the target domain pose a challenge for simulated training. We introduce the EPOpt algorithm, which uses an ensemble of simulated source domains and a form of adversarial training to learn policies that are robust and generalize to a broad range of possible target domains, including to unmodeled effects. Further, the probability distribution over source domains in the ensemble can be adapted using data from the target domain and approximate Bayesian methods, to progressively make it a better approximation. Thus, learning on a model ensemble, along with source domain adaptation, provides the benefit of both robustness and learning.","aravraj@cs.washington.edu, sarvjeet.13it236@nitk.edu.in, ravi@cse.iitm.ac.in, svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu","Aravind Rajeswaran, Sarvjeet Ghotra, Balaraman Ravindran, Sergey Levine","washington.edu, berkeley.edu, iitm.ac.in","Reinforcement Learning, Applications",SyWvgP5el,rajeswaran|epopt_learning_robust_neural_network_policies_using_model_ensembles,EPOpt: Learning Robust Neural Network Policies Using Model Ensembles,An ensemble optimization approach to help transfer neural network policies from simulated domains to real-world target domains.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyWvgP5el&noteId=SyWvgP5el,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyWvgP5el
"Transferring knowledge from prior source tasks in solving a new target task can be useful in several learning applications. The application of transfer poses two serious challenges which have not been adequately addressed. First, the agent should be able to avoid negative transfer, which happens when the transfer hampers or slows down the learning instead of helping it. Second, the agent should be able to selectively transfer, which is the ability to select and transfer from different and multiple source tasks for different parts of the state space of the target task. We propose A2T (Attend Adapt and Transfer), an attentive deep architecture which adapts and transfers from these source tasks. Our model is generic enough to effect transfer of either policies or value functions. Empirical evaluations on different learning algorithms show that A2T is an effective architecture for transfer by being able to avoid negative transfer while transferring selectively from multiple source tasks in the same domain.","rjana@umich.edu, aravindsrinivas@gmail.com, miteshk@cse.iitm.ac.in, prasanna.p@cs.mcgill.ca, ravi@cse.iitm.ac.in","Janarthanan Rajendran, Aravind Lakshminarayanan, Mitesh M.

"Recent work has begun exploring neural acoustic word embeddings–fixed dimensional vector representations of arbitrary-length speech segments corresponding to words. Such embeddings are applicable to speech retrieval and recognition tasks, where reasoning about whole words may make it possible to avoid ambiguous sub-word representations. The main idea is to map acoustic sequences to fixed-dimensional vectors such that examples of the same word are mapped to similar vectors, while different-word examples are mapped to very different vectors. In this work we take a multi-view approach to learning acoustic word embeddings, in which we jointly learn to embed acoustic sequences and their corresponding character sequences. We use deep bidirectional LSTM embedding models and multi-view contrastive losses. We study the effect of different loss variants, including fixed-margin and cost-sensitive losses. Our acoustic word embeddings improve over previous approaches for the task of word discrimination. We also present results on other tasks that are enabled by the multi-view approach, including cross-view word discrimination and word similarity.","wanjia@ttic.edu, weiranwang@ttic.edu, klivescu@ttic.edu","Wanjia He, Weiran Wang, Karen Livescu","uchicago.edu, ttic.edu",,rJxDkvqee,he|multiview_recurrent_neural_acoustic_word_embeddings,Multi-view Recurrent Neural Acoustic Word Embeddings,,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee&noteId=rJxDkvqee,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJxDkvqee
"This paper introduces a new large-scale music dataset, MusicNet, to serve as a source 
of supervision and evaluation of machine learning methods for music research. 
MusicNet consists of hundreds of freely-licensed classical music recordings 
by 10 composers, written for 11 instruments, together with instrument/note 
annotations resulting in over 1 million temporal labels on 34 hours of chamber music
performances under various studio and microphone conditions. 

The paper defines a multi-label classification task to predict notes in musical recordings, 
along with an evaluation protocol, and benchmarks several machine learning architectures for this task: 
i) learning from spectrogram features;

Correctly classified examples tend to have greater maximum softmax probabilities than erroneously classified and out-of-distribution examples, allowing for their detection. We assess performance by defining several tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and automatic speech recognition, showing the effectiveness of this baseline across all. We then show the baseline can sometimes be surpassed, demonstrating the room for future research on these underexplored detection tasks.","dan@ttic.edu, kgimpel@ttic.edu","Dan Hendrycks, Kevin Gimpel","uchicago.edu, ttic.edu",,Hkg4TI9xl,hendrycks|a_baseline_for_detecting_misclassified_and_outofdistribution_examples_in_neural_networks,A Baseline for Detecting Misclassified and Out-of-Distribution Examples in Neural Networks,Methods to Detect When a Network Is Wrong,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg4TI9xl&noteId=Hkg4TI9xl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Hkg4TI9xl
"Code super-optimization is the task of transforming any given program to a more efficient version while preserving its input-output behaviour. In some sense, it is similar to the paraphrase problem from natural language processing where the intention is to change the syntax of an utterance without changing its semantics. Code-optimization has been the subject of years of research that has resulted in the development of rule-based transformation strategies that are used by compilers. More recently, however, a class of stochastic search based methods have been shown to outperform these strategies. This approach involves repeated sampling of modifications to the program from a proposal distribution, which are accepted or rejected based on whether they preserve correctness, and the improvement they achieve. These methods, however, neither learn from past behaviour nor do they try to leverage the semantics of the program under consideration. Motivated by this observation, we present a novel learning based approach for code super-optimization. Intuitively, our method works by learning the proposal distribution using unbiased estimators of the gradient of the expected improvement. Experiments on benchmarks comprising of automatically generated as well as existing (``Hacker's Delight'') programs show that the proposed method is able to significantly outperform state of the art approaches for code super-optimization.","rudy@robots.ox.ac.uk, alban@robots.ox.ac.uk, pawan@robots.ox.ac.uk, philip.torr@eng.ox.ac.uk, pkohli@microsoft.com","Rudy Bunel, Alban Desmaison, M.

"We present a novel layerwise optimization algorithm for the learning objective of Piecewise-Linear Convolutional Neural Networks (PL-CNNs), a large class of convolutional neural networks. Specifically, PL-CNNs employ piecewise linear non-linearities such as the commonly used ReLU and max-pool, and an SVM classifier as the final layer. The key observation of our approach is that the prob- lem corresponding to the parameter estimation of a layer can be formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC) program, which happens to be a latent structured SVM. We optimize the DC program using the concave-convex procedure, which requires us to iteratively solve a structured SVM problem. This allows to design an opti- mization algorithm with an optimal learning rate that does not require any tuning. Using the MNIST, CIFAR and ImageNet data sets, we show that our approach always improves over the state of the art variants of backpropagation and scales to large data and large network settings.","lberrada@robots.ox.ac.uk, az@robots.ox.ac.uk, pawan@robots.ox.ac.uk","Leonard Berrada, Andrew Zisserman, M.

"Deep neural networks can be obscenely wasteful. When processing video, a convolutional network expends a fixed amount of computation for each frame with no regard to the similarity between neighbouring frames. As a result, it ends up repeatedly doing very similar computations. To put an end to such waste, we introduce Sigma-Delta networks. With each new input, each layer in this network sends a discretized form of its change in activation to the next layer. Thus the amount of computation that the network does scales with the amount of change in the input and layer activations, rather than the size of the network. We introduce an optimization method for converting any pre-trained deep network into an optimally efficient Sigma-Delta network, and show that our algorithm, if run on the appropriate hardware, could cut at least an order of magnitude from the computational cost of processing video data.","peter.ed.oconnor@gmail.com, max.welling@uva.nl","Peter O'Connor, Max Welling","uva.nl, qualcomm.com","Computer vision, Deep learning, Applications",HkNRsU5ge,oconnor|sigma_delta_quantized_networks,Sigma Delta Quantized Networks,A deep neural network that saves computation on temporal data by using neurons that only communicate their changes in activation,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge&noteId=HkNRsU5ge,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HkNRsU5ge

Instead of using a vector, we use a 2-D matrix to represent the embedding, with each row of the matrix attending on a different part of the sentence. We also propose a self-attention mechanism and a special regularization term for the model. As a side effect, the embedding comes with an easy way of visualizing what specific parts of the sentence are encoded into the embedding. We evaluate our model on 3 different tasks: author profiling, sentiment classification and textual entailment.

"Regularization is key for deep learning since it allows training more complex models while keeping lower levels of overfitting. However, the most prevalent regularizations do not leverage all the capacity of the models since they rely on reducing the effective number of parameters. Feature decorrelation is an alternative for using the full capacity of the models but the overfitting reduction margins are too narrow given the overhead it introduces. In this paper, we show that regularizing negatively correlated features is an obstacle for effective decorrelation and present OrthoReg, a novel regularization technique that locally enforces feature orthogonality. As a result, imposing locality constraints in feature decorrelation removes interferences between negatively correlated feature weights, allowing the regularizer to reach higher decorrelation bounds, and reducing the overfitting more effectively. 
In particular, we show that the models regularized with OrthoReg have higher accuracy bounds even when batch normalization and dropout are present. Moreover, since our regularization is directly performed on the weights, it is especially suitable for fully convolutional neural networks, where the weight space is constant compared to the feature map space. As a result, we are able to reduce the overfitting of state-of-the-art CNNs on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.","pau.rodriguez@cvc.uab.es, poal@cvc.uab.es, pep.gonfaus@visual-tagging.com, xavier.roca@visual-tagging.com","Pau Rodríguez, Jordi Gonzàlez, Guillem Cucurull, Josep M.

"Maximum entropy modeling is a flexible and popular framework for formulating statistical models given partial knowledge. In this paper, rather than the traditional method of optimizing over the continuous density directly, we learn a smooth and invertible transformation that maps a simple distribution to the desired maximum entropy distribution. Doing so is nontrivial in that the objective being maximized (entropy) is a function of the density itself.  By exploiting recent developments in normalizing flow networks, we cast the maximum entropy problem into a finite-dimensional constrained optimization, and solve the problem by combining stochastic optimization with the augmented Lagrangian method. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and applications to finance and computer vision show the flexibility and accuracy of using maximum entropy flow networks.","gl2480@columbia.edu, yg2312@columbia.edu, jpc2181@columbia.edu","Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem *, Yuanjun Gao *, John P.

"The reparameterization trick enables optimizing large scale stochastic computation graphs via gradient descent. The essence of the trick is to refactor each stochastic node into a differentiable function of its parameters and a random variable with fixed distribution. After refactoring, the gradients of the loss propagated by the chain rule through the graph are low variance unbiased estimators of the gradients of the expected loss. While many continuous random variables have such reparameterizations, discrete random variables lack useful reparameterizations due to the discontinuous nature of discrete states. In this work we introduce Concrete random variables -- continuous relaxations of discrete random variables. The Concrete distribution is a new family of distributions with closed form densities and a simple reparameterization. Whenever a discrete stochastic node of a computation graph can be refactored into a one-hot bit representation that is treated continuously, Concrete stochastic nodes can be used with automatic differentiation to produce low-variance biased gradients of objectives (including objectives that depend on the log-probability of latent stochastic nodes) on the corresponding discrete graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Concrete relaxations on density estimation and structured prediction tasks using neural networks.","cmaddis@stats.ox.ac.uk, amnih@google.com, y.w.teh@stats.ox.ac.uk","Chris J.

We show how this technique solves the common problem of mode collapse, stabilizes training of GANs with complex recurrent generators, and increases diversity and coverage of the data distribution by the generator.","lmetz@google.com, poole@cs.stanford.edu, pfau@google.com, jaschasd@google.com","Luke Metz, Ben Poole, David Pfau, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein",google.com,"Deep learning, Unsupervised Learning, Optimization",BydrOIcle,metz|unrolled_generative_adversarial_networks,Unrolled Generative Adversarial Networks,We introduce a method to stabilize Generative Adversarial Networks by defining the generator objective with respect to an unrolled optimization of the discriminator.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle&noteId=BydrOIcle,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BydrOIcle
"In this paper, we propose TopicRNN, a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based language model designed to directly capture the global semantic meaning relating words in a document via latent topics. Because of their sequential nature, RNNs are good at capturing the local structure of a word sequence – both semantic and syntactic – but might face difficulty remembering long-range dependencies. Intuitively, these long-range dependencies are of semantic nature. In contrast, latent topic models are able to capture the global underlying semantic structure of a document but do not account for word ordering. The proposed TopicRNN model integrates the merits of RNNs and latent topic models: it captures local (syntactic) dependencies using an RNN and global (semantic) dependencies using latent topics. Unlike previous work on contextual RNN language modeling, our model is learned end-to-end. Empirical results on word prediction show that TopicRNN outperforms existing contextual RNN baselines. In addition, TopicRNN can be used as an unsupervised feature extractor for documents. We do this for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset and report an error rate of 6.28%. This is comparable to the state-of-the-art 5.91% resulting from a semi-supervised approach. Finally, TopicRNN also yields sensible topics, making it a useful alternative to document models such as latent Dirichlet allocation.","abd2141@columbia.edu, chowang@microsoft.com, jfgao@microsoft.com, jpaisley@columbia.edu","Adji B.

"Current language modeling architectures often use recurrent neural networks. Recently, various methods for incorporating differentiable memory into these architectures have been proposed. When predicting the next token, these models query information from a memory of the recent history and thus can facilitate learning mid- and long-range dependencies. However, conventional attention models produce a single output vector per time step that is used for predicting the next token as well as the key and value of a differentiable memory of the history of tokens. In this paper, we propose a key-value attention mechanism that produces separate representations for the key and value of a memory, and for a representation that encodes the next-word distribution. This usage of past memories outperforms existing memory-augmented neural language models on two corpora. Yet, we found that it mainly utilizes past memory only of the previous five representations. This led to the unexpected main finding that a much simpler model which simply uses a concatenation of output representations from the previous three-time steps is on par with more sophisticated memory-augmented neural language models.","michal.daniluk.15@ucl.ac.uk, t.rocktaschel@cs.ucl.ac.uk, j.welbl@cs.ucl.ac.uk, s.riedel@cs.ucl.ac.uk","Michał Daniluk, Tim Rocktäschel, Johannes Welbl, Sebastian Riedel","cs.ucl.ac.uk, ucl.ac.uk, google.com, informatik.hu-berlin.de, cs.umass.edu","Natural language processing, Deep learning",ByIAPUcee,daniluk|frustratingly_short_attention_spans_in_neural_language_modeling,Frustratingly Short Attention Spans in Neural Language Modeling,We investigate various memory-augmented neural language models and compare them against state-of-the-art architectures.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee&noteId=ByIAPUcee,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ByIAPUcee
"Segmentation and labeling of high dimensional time series data has wide applications in behavior understanding and medical diagnosis. Due to the difficulty in obtaining the label information for high dimensional data, realizing this objective in an unsupervised way is highly desirable. Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) is a classical tool for this problem. However, existing HSMM and its variants has simple conditional assumptions of observations, thus the ability to capture the nonlinear and complex dynamics within segments is limited. To tackle this limitation, we propose to incorporate the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to model the generative process in HSMM, resulting the Recurrent HSMM (R-HSMM). To accelerate the inference while preserving accuracy, we designed a structure encoding function to mimic the exact inference. By generalizing the penalty method to distribution space, we are able to train the model and the encoding function simultaneously. Empirical results show that the proposed R-HSMM achieves the state-of-the-art performances on both synthetic and real-world datasets.","hanjundai@gatech.edu, bodai@gatech.edu, ymzhang@nlpr.ia.ac.cn, sli370@gatech.edu, lsong@cc.gatech.edu","Hanjun Dai, Bo Dai, Yan-Ming Zhang, Shuang Li, Le Song","gatech.edu, nlpr.ia.ac.cn, purdue.edu","Deep learning, Unsupervised Learning, Structured prediction",HJGODLqgx,dai|recurrent_hidden_semimarkov_model,Recurrent Hidden Semi-Markov Model,We propose to incorporate the RNN to model the generative process in Hidden Semi-Markov Model for unsupervised segmentation and labeling.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx&noteId=HJGODLqgx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJGODLqgx

"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a framework for producing a generative model by way of a two-player minimax game.  In this paper, we propose the \emph{Generative Multi-Adversarial Network} (GMAN), a framework that extends GANs to multiple discriminators. In previous work, the successful training of GANs requires modifying the minimax objective to accelerate training early on. In contrast, GMAN can be reliably trained with the original, untampered objective. We explore a number of design perspectives with the discriminator role ranging from formidable adversary to forgiving teacher.  Image generation tasks comparing the proposed framework to standard GANs demonstrate GMAN produces higher quality samples in a fraction of the iterations when measured by a pairwise GAM-type metric.","idurugkar@cs.umass.edu, imgemp@cs.umass.edu, mahadeva@cs.umass.edu","Ishan Durugkar, Ian Gemp, Sridhar Mahadevan",cs.umass.edu,"Deep learning, Unsupervised Learning, Games",Byk-VI9eg,durugkar|generative_multiadversarial_networks,Generative Multi-Adversarial Networks,GANs with multiple discriminators accelerate training to more robust performance.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg&noteId=Byk-VI9eg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Byk-VI9eg
"The optimization of deep neural networks can be more challenging than the traditional convex optimization problems due to highly non-convex nature of the loss function, e.g. it can involve pathological landscapes such as saddle-surfaces that can be difficult to escape from for algorithms based on simple gradient descent. In this paper, we attack the problem of optimization of highly non-convex neural networks objectives by starting with a smoothed -- or mollified -- objective function which becomes more complex as the training proceeds.  Our proposition is inspired by the recent studies in continuation methods: similarly to curriculum methods, we begin by learning an easier (possibly convex) objective function and let it evolve during training until it eventually becomes the original, difficult to optimize objective function. The complexity of the mollified networks is controlled by a single hyperparameter that is annealed during training. We show improvements on various difficult optimization tasks and establish a relationship between recent works on continuation methods for neural networks and mollifiers.","gulcehrc@iro.umontreal.ca, marcin-m@post.pl, fvisin@gmail.com, yoshua.umontreal@gmail.com","Caglar Gulcehre, Marcin Moczulski, Francesco Visin, Yoshua Bengio","umontreal.ca, oxford.ac.uk, polimi.it","Deep learning, Optimization",r1G4z8cge,gulcehre|mollifying_networks,Mollifying Networks,"We are proposing a new continuation method for neural networks, that starts from optimizing a convex objective function and gradually during the training the function evolves into more non-convex function.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge&noteId=r1G4z8cge,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1G4z8cge
"Learning an interpretable factorised representation of the independent data generative factors of the world without supervision is an important precursor for the development of artificial intelligence that is able to learn and reason in the same way that humans do. We introduce beta-VAE, a new state-of-the-art framework for automated discovery of interpretable factorised latent representations from raw image data in a completely unsupervised manner. Our approach is a modification of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. We introduce an adjustable hyperparameter beta that balances latent channel capacity and independence constraints with reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate that beta-VAE with appropriately tuned beta > 1 qualitatively outperforms VAE (beta = 1), as well as state of the art unsupervised (InfoGAN) and semi-supervised (DC-IGN) approaches to disentangled factor learning on a variety of datasets (celebA, faces and chairs). Furthermore, we devise a protocol to quantitatively compare the degree of disentanglement learnt by different models, and show that our approach also significantly outperforms all baselines quantitatively. Unlike InfoGAN, beta-VAE is stable to train, makes few assumptions about the data and relies on tuning a single hyperparameter, which can be directly optimised through a hyper parameter search using weakly labelled data or through heuristic visual inspection for purely unsupervised data.","irinah@google.com, lmatthey@google.com, arkap@google.com, cpburgess@google.com, glorotx@google.com, botvinick@google.com, shakir@google.com, lerchner@google.com","Irina Higgins, Loic Matthey, Arka Pal, Christopher Burgess, Xavier Glorot, Matthew Botvinick, Shakir Mohamed, Alexander Lerchner",google.com,,Sy2fzU9gl,higgins|betavae_learning_basic_visual_concepts_with_a_constrained_variational_framework,beta-VAE: Learning Basic Visual Concepts with a Constrained Variational Framework,"We introduce beta-VAE, a new state-of-the-art framework for automated discovery of interpretable factorised latent representations from raw image data in a completely unsupervised manner.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy2fzU9gl&noteId=Sy2fzU9gl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy2fzU9gl
"Usually bilingual word vectors are trained ""online''. Mikolov et al. showed they can also be found ""offline""; whereby two pre-trained embeddings are aligned with a linear transformation, using dictionaries compiled from expert knowledge. In this work, we prove that the linear transformation between two spaces should be orthogonal. This transformation can be obtained using the singular value decomposition.

Orthogonal transformations are more robust to noise, enabling us to learn the transformation without expert bilingual signal by constructing a ""pseudo-dictionary"" from the identical character strings which appear in both languages, achieving 40% precision on the same test set.

"This article presents the prediction difference analysis method for visualizing the response of a deep neural network to a specific input. When classifying images, the method highlights areas in a given input image that provide evidence for or against a certain class. It overcomes several shortcoming of previous methods and provides great additional insight into the decision making process of classifiers. Making neural network decisions interpretable through visualization is important both to improve models and to accelerate the adoption of black-box classifiers in application areas such as medicine.

"Categorical variables are a natural choice for representing discrete structure in the world. However, stochastic neural networks rarely use categorical latent variables due to the inability to backpropagate through samples. In this work, we present an efficient gradient estimator that replaces the non-differentiable sample from a categorical distribution with a differentiable sample from a novel Gumbel-Softmax distribution. This distribution has the essential property that it can be smoothly annealed into a categorical distribution. We show that our Gumbel-Softmax estimator outperforms state-of-the-art gradient estimators on structured output prediction and unsupervised generative modeling tasks with categorical latent variables, and enables large speedups on semi-supervised classification.","ejang@google.com, sg717@cam.ac.uk, poole@cs.stanford.edu","Eric Jang, Shixiang Gu, Ben Poole",google.com,"Deep learning, Semi-Supervised Learning, Optimization, Structured prediction",rkE3y85ee,jang|categorical_reparameterization_with_gumbelsoftmax,Categorical Reparameterization with Gumbel-Softmax,"Simple, differentiable sampling mechanism for categorical variables that can be trained in neural nets via standard backprop.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE3y85ee&noteId=rkE3y85ee,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkE3y85ee
"We consider the problem of inferring a sequence of hidden states associated with a sequence of observations produced by an individual within a population.  Instead of learning a single sequence model for the population (which does not account for variations within the population), we learn a set of basis sequence models based on different individuals.  The sequence of hidden states for a new individual is inferred in an online fashion by estimating a distribution over the basis models that best explain the sequence of observations of this new individual.  We explain how to do this in the context of hidden Markov models with Gaussian mixture models that are learned based on streaming data by online Bayesian moment matching.  The resulting transfer learning technique is demonstrated with three real-word applications: activity recognition based on smartphone sensors, sleep classification based on electroencephalography data and the prediction of the direction of future packet flows between a pair of servers in telecommunication networks.","pjaini@uwaterloo.ca, chenzhitang2@huawei.com, pablo@veedata.io, edith.law@uwaterloo.ca, lmiddlet@uwaterloo.ca, kregan@uwaterloo.ca, mschaekermann@uwaterloo.ca, g.trimponias@huawei.com, james.tung@uwaterloo.ca, ppoupart@uwaterloo.ca","Priyank Jaini, Zhitang Chen, Pablo Carbajal, Edith Law, Laura Middleton, Kayla Regan, Mike Schaekermann, George Trimponias, James Tung, Pascal Poupart",uwaterloo.ca,"Unsupervised Learning, Transfer Learning, Applications",ByqiJIqxg,jaini|online_bayesian_transfer_learning_for_sequential_data_modeling,Online Bayesian Transfer Learning for Sequential Data Modeling,,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByqiJIqxg&noteId=ByqiJIqxg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ByqiJIqxg
"Sequence-to-sequence models rely on a fixed decomposition of the target sequences into a sequence of tokens that may be words, word-pieces or characters. The choice of these tokens and the decomposition of the target sequences into a sequence of tokens is often static, and independent of the input, output data domains. This can potentially lead to a sub-optimal choice of token dictionaries, as the decomposition is not informed by the particular problem being solved. In this paper we present Latent Sequence Decompositions (LSD), a framework in which the decomposition of sequences into constituent tokens is learnt during the training of the model. The decomposition depends both on the input sequence and on the output sequence. In LSD, during training, the model samples decompositions incrementally, from left to right by locally sampling between valid extensions. We experiment with the Wall Street Journal speech recognition task. Our LSD model achieves 12.9% WER compared to a character baseline of 14.8% WER. When combined with a convolutional network on the encoder, we achieve a WER of 9.6%.","williamchan@cmu.edu, yzhang87@mit.edu, qvl@google.com, ndjaitly@google.com","William Chan, Yu Zhang, Quoc Le, Navdeep Jaitly","google.com, cmu.edu, mit.edu","Speech, Applications, Natural language processing, Deep learning",SyQq185lg,chan|latent_sequence_decompositions,Latent Sequence Decompositions,,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg&noteId=SyQq185lg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyQq185lg
"Although various scalable deep learning software packages have been proposed, it remains unclear how to best leverage parallel and distributed computing infrastructure to accelerate their training and deployment. Moreover, the effectiveness of existing parallel and distributed systems varies widely based on the neural network architecture and dataset under consideration.  In order to efficiently explore the space of scalable deep learning systems and quickly diagnose their effectiveness for a given problem instance, we introduce an analytical performance model called Paleo. Our key observation is that a neural network architecture carries with it a declarative specification of the computational requirements associated with its training and evaluation. By extracting these requirements from a given architecture and mapping them to a specific point within the design space of software, hardware and communication strategies, Paleo can efficiently and accurately model the expected scalability and performance of a putative deep learning system.  We show that Paleo is robust to the choice of network architecture, hardware, software, communication schemes, and parallelization strategies. We further demonstrate its ability to accurately model various recently published scalability results for CNNs such as NiN, Inception and AlexNet.","hangqi@cs.ucla.edu, sparks@cs.berkeley.edu, ameet@cs.ucla.edu","Hang Qi, Evan R.

"Policy gradient is an efficient technique for improving a policy in a reinforcement learning setting. However, vanilla online variants are on-policy only and not able to take advantage of off-policy data. In this paper we describe a new technique that combines policy gradient with off-policy Q-learning, drawing experience from a replay buffer. This is motivated by making a connection between the fixed points of the regularized policy gradient algorithm and the Q-values. This connection allows us to estimate the Q-values from the action preferences of the policy, to which we apply Q-learning updates. We refer to the new technique as ‘PGQL’, for policy gradient and Q-learning. We also establish an equivalency between action-value fitting techniques and actor-critic algorithms, showing that regularized policy gradient techniques can be interpreted as advantage function learning algorithms. We conclude with some numerical examples that demonstrate improved data efficiency and stability of PGQL. In particular, we tested PGQL on the full suite of Atari games and achieved performance exceeding that of both asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) and Q-learning.","bodonoghue@google.com, munos@google.com, korayk@google.com, vmnih@google.com","Brendan O'Donoghue, Remi Munos, Koray Kavukcuoglu, Volodymyr Mnih",google.com,"Deep learning, Reinforcement Learning",B1kJ6H9ex,odonoghue|combining_policy_gradient_and_qlearning,Combining policy gradient and Q-learning,We combine a policy gradient style update with a Q-learning style update into a single RL algorithm we call PGQL.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1kJ6H9ex&noteId=B1kJ6H9ex,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1kJ6H9ex

"Learning a natural language interface for database tables is a challenging task that involves deep language understanding and multi-step reasoning. The task is often approached by mapping natural language queries to logical forms or programs that provide the desired response when executed on the database. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first weakly supervised, end-to-end neural network model to induce such programs on a real-world dataset. We enhance the objective function of Neural Programmer, a neural network with built-in discrete operations, and apply it on WikiTableQuestions, a natural language question-answering dataset. The model is trained end-to-end with weak supervision of question-answer pairs, and does not require domain-specific grammars, rules, or annotations that are key elements in previous approaches to program induction. The main experimental result in this paper is that a single Neural Programmer model achieves 34.2% accuracy using only 10,000 examples with weak supervision. An ensemble of 15 models, with a trivial combination technique, achieves 37.7% accuracy, which is competitive to the current state-of-the-art accuracy of 37.1% obtained by a traditional natural language semantic parser.","arvind@cs.umass.edu, qvl@google.com, abadi@google.com, mccallum@cs.umass.edu, damodei@openai.com","Arvind Neelakantan, Quoc V.

In particular we consider jointly learning the goal-driven reinforcement learning problem with an unsupervised depth prediction task and a self-supervised loop closure classification task. Using this approach we can learn to navigate from raw sensory input in complicated 3D mazes, approaching human-level performance even under conditions where the goal location changes frequently.

patterns in the transition dynamics (e.g. multi-modality and

our BNNs by minimizing $\alpha$-divergences with $\alpha = 0.5$, which usually produces better

"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used extensively and with increasing success to model various types of sequential data. Much of this progress has been achieved through devising recurrent units and architectures with the flexibility to capture complex statistics in the data, such as long range dependency or localized attention phenomena. However, while many sequential data (such as video, speech or language) can have highly variable information flow, most recurrent models still consume input features at a constant rate and perform a constant number of computations per time step, which can be detrimental to both speed and model capacity. In this paper, we explore a modification to existing recurrent units which allows them to learn to vary the amount of computation they perform at each step, without prior knowledge of the sequence's time structure. We show experimentally that not only do our models require fewer operations, they also lead to better performance overall on evaluation tasks.","yacine.jernite@nyu.edu, egrave@fb.com, ajoulin@fb.com, tmikolov@fb.com","Yacine Jernite, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin, Tomas Mikolov","nyu.edu, fb.com","Natural language processing, Deep learning",S1LVSrcge,jernite|variable_computation_in_recurrent_neural_networks,Variable Computation in Recurrent Neural Networks,"We show that an RNN can learn to control the amount of computation it does at each time step, leading to better efficiency and performance as well as discovering time patterns of interest.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge&noteId=S1LVSrcge,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1LVSrcge

Unlike direct models which can suffer from explaining-away effects during training, noisy channel models must produce outputs that explain their inputs, and their component models can be trained with not only paired training samples but also unpaired samples from the marginal output distribution. Using a latent variable to control how much of the conditioning sequence the channel model needs to read in order to generate a subsequent symbol, we obtain a tractable and effective beam search decoder.

"We study the behavior of untrained neural networks whose weights and biases are randomly distributed using mean field theory. We show the existence of depth scales that naturally limit the maximum depth of signal propagation through these random networks. Our main practical result is to show that random networks may be trained precisely when information can travel through them. Thus, the depth scales that we identify provide bounds on how deep a network may be trained for a specific choice of hyperparameters. As a corollary to this, we argue that in networks at the edge of chaos, one of these depth scales diverges. Thus arbitrarily deep networks may be trained only sufficiently close to criticality.

"We introduce a design strategy for neural network macro-architecture based on self-similarity.  Repeated application of a simple expansion rule generates deep networks whose structural layouts are precisely truncated fractals.  These networks contain interacting subpaths of different lengths, but do not include any pass-through or residual connections; every internal signal is transformed by a filter and nonlinearity before being seen by subsequent layers.  In experiments, fractal networks match the excellent performance of standard residual networks on both CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, thereby demonstrating that residual representations may not be fundamental to the success of extremely deep convolutional neural networks.  Rather, the key may be the ability to transition, during training, from effectively shallow to deep.  We note similarities with student-teacher behavior and develop drop-path, a natural extension of dropout, to regularize co-adaptation of subpaths in fractal architectures.  Such regularization allows extraction of high-performance fixed-depth subnetworks.  Additionally, fractal networks exhibit an anytime property: shallow subnetworks provide a quick answer, while deeper subnetworks, with higher latency, provide a more accurate answer.","larsson@cs.uchicago.edu, mmaire@ttic.edu, greg@ttic.edu","Gustav Larsson, Michael Maire, Gregory Shakhnarovich","uchicago.edu, ttic.edu, berkeley.edu, caltech.edu",,S1VaB4cex,larsson|fractalnet_ultradeep_neural_networks_without_residuals,FractalNet: Ultra-Deep Neural Networks without Residuals,,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex&noteId=S1VaB4cex,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1VaB4cex
"The goal of two-sample tests is to assess whether two samples, $S_P \sim P^n$ and $S_Q \sim Q^m$, are drawn from the same distribution.  Perhaps intriguingly, one relatively unexplored method to build two-sample tests is the use of binary classifiers. In particular, construct a dataset by pairing the $n$ examples in $S_P$ with a positive label, and by pairing the $m$ examples in $S_Q$ with a negative label. If the null hypothesis ``$P = Q$'' is true, then the classification accuracy of a binary classifier on a held-out subset of this dataset should remain near chance-level.  As we will show, such \emph{Classifier Two-Sample Tests} (C2ST) learn a suitable representation of the data on the fly, return test statistics in interpretable units, have a simple null distribution, and their predictive uncertainty allow to interpret where $P$ and $Q$ differ.

The goal of this paper is to establish the properties, performance, and uses of C2ST.  First, we analyze their main theoretical properties.  Second, we compare their performance against a variety of state-of-the-art alternatives.  Third, we propose their use to evaluate the sample quality of generative models with intractable likelihoods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).  Fourth, we showcase the novel application of GANs together with C2ST for causal discovery.","dlp@fb.com, qas@fb.com","David Lopez-Paz, Maxime Oquab","fb.com, ens.fr, inria.fr, microsoft.com","Theory, Unsupervised Learning",SJkXfE5xx,lopezpaz|revisiting_classifier_twosample_tests,Revisiting Classifier Two-Sample Tests,"Modern binary classifiers can be easily turned into powerful two-sample tests, and used to evaluate generative models.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx&noteId=SJkXfE5xx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJkXfE5xx
"The loss surface of deep neural networks has recently attracted interest 
in the optimization and machine learning communities as a prime example of 
high-dimensional non-convex problem. Some insights were recently gained using spin glass 
models and mean-field approximations, but at the expense of strongly simplifying the nonlinear nature of the model.

In this work, we do not make any such approximation and study conditions 
on the data distribution and model architecture that prevent the existence 
of bad local minima. Our theoretical work quantifies and formalizes two 
important folklore facts: (i) the landscape of deep linear networks has a radically different topology 
from that of deep half-rectified ones, and (ii) that the energy landscape 
in the non-linear case is fundamentally controlled by the interplay between the smoothness of the data distribution and model over-parametrization. Our main theoretical contribution is to prove that half-rectified single layer networks are asymptotically connected, and we provide explicit bounds that reveal the aforementioned interplay.

The conditioning of gradient descent is the next challenge we address. 
We study this question through the geometry of the level sets, and we introduce
an algorithm to efficiently estimate the regularity of such sets on large-scale networks. 
Our empirical results show that these level sets remain connected throughout 
all the learning phase, suggesting a near convex behavior, but they become 
exponentially more curvy as the energy level decays, in accordance to what is observed in practice with 
very low curvature attractors.","daniel.freeman@berkeley.edu, bruna@cims.nyu.edu","C.

"Reinforcement Learning algorithms can learn complex behavioral patterns for sequential decision making tasks wherein an agent interacts with an environment and acquires feedback in the form of rewards sampled from it. Traditionally, such algorithms make decisions, i.e., select actions to execute, at every single time step of the agent-environment interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Fine Grained Action Repetition (FiGAR), which enables the agent to decide the action as well as the time scale of repeating it.
FiGAR can be used for improving any Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm which maintains an explicit policy estimate  by enabling temporal abstractions in the action space and implicitly enabling planning through sequences of repetitive macro-actions.  
We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by showing performance improvements on top of three policy search algorithms in different domains: Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic in the Atari 2600 domain, Trust Region Policy Optimization in Mujoco domain and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients in the TORCS car racing domain.","ssahil08@gmail.com, aravindsrinivas@gmail.com, ravi@cse.iitm.ac.in","Sahil Sharma, Aravind S.

"Deep neural network models, though very powerful and highly successful, are computationally expensive in terms of space and time. Recently, there have been a number of attempts on binarizing the network weights and activations. This greatly reduces the network size, and replaces the underlying multiplications to additions or even XNOR bit operations. However, existing binarization schemes are based on simple matrix approximations and ignore the effect of binarization on the loss. In this paper, we propose a proximal Newton algorithm with diagonal Hessian approximation that directly minimizes the loss w.r.t. the binarized weights. The underlying proximal step has an efficient closed-form solution, and the second-order information can be efficiently obtained from the second moments already computed by the Adam optimizer. Experiments on both feedforward and recurrent networks show that the proposed loss-aware binarization algorithm outperforms existing binarization schemes, and is also more robust for wide and deep networks.","lhouab@cse.ust.hk, qyaoaa@cse.ust.hk, jamesk@cse.ust.hk","Lu Hou, Quanming Yao, James T.

"We introduce the ""Energy-based Generative Adversarial Network"" model (EBGAN) which views the discriminator as an energy function that attributes low energies to the regions near the data manifold and higher energies to other regions. Similar to the probabilistic GANs, a generator is seen as being trained to produce contrastive samples with minimal energies, while the discriminator is trained to assign high energies to these generated samples. Viewing the discriminator as an energy function allows to use a wide variety of architectures and loss functionals in addition to the usual binary classifier with logistic output. Among them, we show one instantiation of EBGAN framework as using an auto-encoder architecture, with the energy being the reconstruction error, in place of the discriminator. We show that this form of EBGAN exhibits more stable behavior than regular GANs during training. We also show that a single-scale architecture can be trained to generate high-resolution images.","jakezhao@cs.nyu.edu, mathieu@cs.nyu.edu, yann@cs.nyu.edu","Junbo Zhao, Michael Mathieu, Yann LeCun","cs.nyu.edu, fb.com","Deep learning, Unsupervised Learning, Semi-Supervised Learning",ryh9pmcee,zhao|energybased_generative_adversarial_networks,Energy-based Generative Adversarial Networks,"We introduce the ""Energy-based Generative Adversarial Network"" (EBGAN) model.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee&noteId=ryh9pmcee,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryh9pmcee
"The learning of domain-invariant representations in the context of domain adaptation with neural networks is considered. We propose a new regularization method that minimizes the  domain-specific latent feature representations directly in the hidden activation space. Although some standard distribution matching approaches exist that can be interpreted as the matching of weighted sums of moments, e.g. Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), an explicit order-wise matching of higher order moments has not been considered before.
We propose to match the higher order central moments of probability distributions by means of order-wise moment differences. Our model does not require computationally expensive distance and kernel matrix computations. We utilize the equivalent representation of probability distributions by moment sequences to define a new distance function, called Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD). We prove that CMD is a metric on the set of probability distributions on a compact interval. We further prove that convergence of probability distributions on compact intervals w.r.t. the new metric implies convergence in distribution of the respective random variables.
We test our approach on two different benchmark data sets for object recognition (Office) and sentiment analysis of product reviews (Amazon reviews). CMD achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on most domain adaptation tasks of Office and outperforms networks trained with MMD, Variational Fair Autoencoders and Domain Adversarial Neural Networks on Amazon reviews. In addition, a post-hoc parameter sensitivity analysis shows that the new approach is stable w. r. t. parameter changes in a certain interval. The source code of the experiments is publicly available.","werner.zellinger@jku.at, thomas.grubinger@scch.at, edwin.lughofer@jku.at, thomas.natschlaeger@scch.at, susanne.saminger-platz@jku.at","Werner Zellinger, Thomas Grubinger, Edwin Lughofer, Thomas Natschläger, Susanne Saminger-Platz","scch.at, jku.at","Transfer Learning, Deep learning, Computer vision",SkB-_mcel,zellinger|central_moment_discrepancy_cmd_for_domaininvariant_representation_learning,Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD) for Domain-Invariant Representation Learning,A new method for hidden activation distribution matching in the context of domain adaptation.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkB-_mcel&noteId=SkB-_mcel,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SkB-_mcel
"This paper presents incremental network quantization (INQ), a novel method, targeting to efficiently convert any pre-trained full-precision convolutional neural network (CNN) model into a low-precision version whose weights are constrained to be either powers of two or zero. Unlike existing methods which are struggled in noticeable accuracy loss, our INQ has the potential to resolve this issue, as benefiting from two innovations. On one hand, we introduce three interdependent operations, namely weight partition, group-wise quantization and re-training. A well-proven measure is employed to divide the weights in each layer of a pre-trained CNN model into two disjoint groups. The weights in the first group are responsible to form a low-precision base, thus they are quantized by a variable-length encoding method. The weights in the other group are responsible to compensate for the accuracy loss from the quantization, thus they are the ones to be re-trained. On the other hand, these three operations are repeated on the latest re-trained group in an iterative manner until all the weights are converted into low-precision ones, acting as an incremental network quantization and accuracy enhancement procedure. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet classification task using almost all known deep CNN architectures including AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet and ResNets well testify the efficacy of the proposed method. Specifically, at 5-bit quantization (a variable-length encoding: 1 bit for representing zero value, and the remaining 4 bits represent at most 16 different values for the powers of two), our models have improved accuracy than the 32-bit floating-point references. Taking ResNet-18 as an example, we further show that our quantized models with 4-bit, 3-bit and 2-bit ternary weights have improved or very similar accuracy against its 32-bit floating-point baseline. Besides, impressive results with the combination of network pruning and INQ are also reported. We believe that our method sheds new insights on how to make deep CNNs to be applicable on mobile or embedded devices. The code will be made publicly available.","aojun.zhou@intel.com, anbang.yao@intel.com, yiwen.guo@intel.com, lin.x.xu@intel.com, yurong.chen@intel.com","Aojun Zhou, Anbang Yao, Yiwen Guo, Lin Xu, Yurong Chen","intel.com, tsinghua.edu.cn, ia.ac.cn","Deep learning, Optimization",HyQJ-mclg,zhou|incremental_network_quantization_towards_lossless_cnns_with_lowprecision_weights,Incremental Network Quantization: Towards Lossless CNNs with Low-precision Weights,"This paper presents INQ, targeting to efficiently transform any pre-trained full-precision convolutional neural network (CNN) model into a low-precision version whose connection weights are constrained to be either powers of two or zero.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQJ-mclg&noteId=HyQJ-mclg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HyQJ-mclg
"This paper proposes a new optimization algorithm called Entropy-SGD for training deep neural networks that is motivated by the local geometry of the energy landscape. Local extrema with low generalization error have a large proportion of almost-zero eigenvalues in the Hessian with very few positive or negative eigenvalues. We leverage upon this observation to construct a local-entropy-based objective function that favors well-generalizable solutions lying in large flat regions of the energy landscape, while avoiding poorly-generalizable solutions located in the sharp valleys. Conceptually, our algorithm resembles two nested loops of SGD where we use Langevin dynamics in the inner loop to compute the gradient of the local entropy before each update of the weights. We show that the new objective has a smoother energy landscape and show improved generalization over SGD using uniform stability, under certain assumptions. Our experiments on convolutional and recurrent neural networks demonstrate that Entropy-SGD compares favorably to state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generalization error and training time.","pratikac@ucla.edu, achoroma@cims.nyu.edu, soatto@cs.ucla.edu, yann@cs.nyu.edu, carlo.baldassi@polito.it, borgs@microsoft.com, jchayes@microsoft.com, sagun@cims.nyu.edu, riccardo.zecchina@polito.it","Pratik Chaudhari, Anna Choromanska, Stefano Soatto, Yann LeCun, Carlo Baldassi, Christian Borgs, Jennifer Chayes, Levent Sagun, Riccardo Zecchina","ucla.edu, cs.ucla.edu, nyu.edu, microsoft.com, gwu.edu, nyu.edu, cims.nyu.edu, columbia.edu, facebook.com, microsoft.com, polito.it","Deep learning, Optimization",B1YfAfcgl,chaudhari|entropysgd_biasing_gradient_descent_into_wide_valleys,Entropy-SGD: Biasing Gradient Descent Into Wide Valleys,This paper focuses on developing new optimization tools for deep learning that are tailored to exploit the local geometric properties of the objective function.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1YfAfcgl&noteId=B1YfAfcgl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1YfAfcgl

This ensemble prediction can be expected to be a better predictor for the unknown labels than the output of the network at the most recent training epoch, and can thus be used as a target for training. Using our method, we set new records for two standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks, reducing the (non-augmented) classification error rate from 18.44% to 7.05% in SVHN with 500 labels and from 18.63% to 16.55% in CIFAR-10 with 4000 labels, and further to 5.12% and 12.16% by enabling the standard augmentations.

"Machine learning and  deep learning in particular has advanced tremendously on perceptual tasks in recent years. However, it remains vulnerable against adversarial perturbations of the input that have been crafted specifically to fool the system while being quasi-imperceptible to a human. In this work, we propose to augment deep neural networks with a small ``detector'' subnetwork which is trained on the binary classification task of distinguishing genuine data from data containing adversarial perturbations. Our method is orthogonal to prior work on addressing adversarial perturbations, which has mostly focused on making the classification network itself more robust.  We show empirically that adversarial perturbations can be detected surprisingly well even though they are quasi-imperceptible to humans. Moreover, while the detectors have been trained to detect only a specific adversary, they generalize to similar and weaker adversaries. In addition, we propose an adversarial attack that fools both the classifier and the detector and a novel training procedure for the detector that counteracts this attack.","JanHendrik.Metzen@de.bosch.com, Tim.Genewein@de.bosch.com, Volker.Fischer@de.bosch.com, Bastian.Bischoff@de.bosch.com","Jan Hendrik Metzen, Tim Genewein, Volker Fischer, Bastian Bischoff","bosch.com, uni-bremen.de, dfki.de, in.tum.de, ias.tu-darmstadt.de, tuebingen.mpg.de, uni-tuebingen.de","Computer vision, Deep learning, Supervised Learning",SJzCSf9xg,metzen|on_detecting_adversarial_perturbations,On Detecting Adversarial Perturbations,We present and evaluate an approach for detecting adversarial perturbations in images based on attaching a small subnetwork to a deep neural network that is trained specifically to detect adversarial perturbations.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg&noteId=SJzCSf9xg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJzCSf9xg
"The availability of large datsets has enabled neural networks to achieve impressive recognition results. However, the presence of inaccurate class labels is known  to deteriorate the performance of even the best classifiers in a broad range of classification problems. Noisy labels also  tend to be more harmful than noisy attributes. When the observed label is noisy, we can view the correct label as a latent random variable and model the noise processes by a communication channel with unknown parameters. Thus we can apply the EM algorithm to find the parameters of both the network and the noise  and to estimate the correct label. In this study we present a neural-network approach that optimizes  the same likelihood function as optimized by the EM algorithm. The noise is explicitly modeled by an additional softmax layer that connects the correct labels to the noisy ones. This scheme is then extended  to the case where the noisy labels are dependent  on the features in addition to the correct labels.

"An intriguing property of deep neural networks is the existence of adversarial examples, which can transfer among different architectures. These transferable adversarial examples may severely hinder deep neural network-based applications. Previous works mostly study the transferability using small scale datasets. In this work, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the transferability over large models and a large scale dataset, and we are also the first to study the transferability of targeted adversarial examples with their target labels. We study both non-targeted and targeted adversarial examples, and show that while transferable non-targeted adversarial examples are easy to find, targeted adversarial examples generated using existing approaches almost never transfer with their target labels. Therefore, we propose novel ensemble-based approaches to generating transferable adversarial examples. Using such approaches, we observe a large proportion of targeted adversarial examples that are able to transfer with their target labels for the first time. We also present some geometric studies to help understanding the transferable adversarial examples.

"An emerging design principle in deep learning is that each layer of a deep
artificial neural network should be able to easily express the identity
transformation. This idea not only motivated various normalization techniques,
such as batch normalization, but was also key to the immense success of
residual networks.

In this work, we put the principle of identity parameterization on a more 
solid theoretical footing alongside further empirical progress. We first
give a strikingly simple proof that arbitrarily deep linear residual networks
have no spurious local optima. The same result for feed-forward networks in
their standard parameterization is substantially more delicate.  Second, we
show that residual networks with ReLu activations have universal finite-sample
expressivity in the sense that the network can represent any function of its
sample provided that the model has more parameters than the sample size.

Directly inspired by our theory, we experiment with a radically simple
residual architecture consisting of only residual convolutional layers and
ReLu activations, but no batch normalization, dropout, or max pool. Our model

"The ability of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework to learn generative models mapping from simple latent distributions to arbitrarily complex data distributions has been demonstrated empirically, with compelling results showing generators learn to ""linearize semantics"" in the latent space of such models. Intuitively, such latent spaces may serve as useful feature representations for auxiliary problems where semantics are relevant. However, in their existing form, GANs have no means of learning the inverse mapping -- projecting data back into the latent space. We propose Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGANs) as a means of learning this inverse mapping, and demonstrate that the resulting learned feature representation is useful for auxiliary supervised discrimination tasks, competitive with contemporary approaches to unsupervised and self-supervised feature learning.","jdonahue@cs.berkeley.edu, philkr@utexas.edu, trevor@eecs.berkeley.edu","Jeff Donahue, Philipp Krähenbühl, Trevor Darrell","berkeley.edu, utexas.edu",,BJtNZAFgg,donahue|adversarial_feature_learning,Adversarial Feature Learning,,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJtNZAFgg&noteId=BJtNZAFgg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJtNZAFgg
"Network quantization is one of network compression techniques to reduce the redundancy of deep neural networks. It reduces the number of distinct network parameter values by quantization in order to save the storage for them. In this paper, we design network quantization schemes that minimize the performance loss due to quantization given a compression ratio constraint. We analyze the quantitative relation of quantization errors to the neural network loss function and identify that the Hessian-weighted distortion measure is locally the right objective function for the optimization of network quantization. As a result, Hessian-weighted k-means clustering is proposed for clustering network parameters to quantize. When optimal variable-length binary codes, e.g., Huffman codes, are employed for further compression, we derive that the network quantization problem can be related to the entropy-constrained scalar quantization (ECSQ) problem in information theory and consequently propose two solutions of ECSQ for network quantization, i.e., uniform quantization and an iterative solution similar to Lloyd's algorithm. Finally, using the simple uniform quantization followed by Huffman coding, we show from our experiments that the compression ratios of 51.25, 22.17 and 40.65 are achievable for LeNet, 32-layer ResNet and AlexNet, respectively.","yoojin.c@samsung.com, mostafa.e@samsung.com, jungwon2.lee@samsung.com","Yoojin Choi, Mostafa El-Khamy, Jungwon Lee",samsung.com,"Theory, Deep learning",rJ8uNptgl,choi|towards_the_limit_of_network_quantization,Towards the Limit of Network Quantization,,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl&noteId=rJ8uNptgl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJ8uNptgl
"Phenomenally successful in practical inference problems, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are widely deployed in mobile devices, data centers, and even supercomputers.
The number of parameters needed in CNNs, however, are often large and undesirable. Consequently, various methods have been developed to prune a CNN once it is trained. 
Nevertheless, the resulting CNNs offer limited benefits. While pruning the fully connected layers reduces a CNN's size considerably, it does not improve inference speed noticeably as the compute heavy parts lie in convolutions. Pruning CNNs in a way that increase inference speed often imposes specific sparsity structures, thus limiting the achievable sparsity levels.

We present a method to realize simultaneously size economy and speed improvement while pruning CNNs. Paramount to our success is an efficient general sparse-with-dense matrix
multiplication implementation that is applicable to convolution of feature maps with kernels of arbitrary sparsity patterns. Complementing this, we developed a performance model that predicts sweet spots of sparsity levels for different layers and on different computer architectures. Together, these two allow us to demonstrate 3.1-7.3x convolution speedups over dense convolution in AlexNet, on Intel Atom, Xeon, and Xeon Phi processors, spanning the spectrum from mobile devices to supercomputers.","jongsoo.park@intel.com, sheng.r.li@intel.com, peter.tang@intel.com, weiwen.web@gmail.com, HAL66@pitt.edu, yic52@pitt.edu, pradeep.dubey@intel.com","Jongsoo Park, Sheng Li, Wei Wen, Ping Tak Peter Tang, Hai Li, Yiran Chen, Pradeep Dubey","intel.com, stanford.edu, pitt.edu","Deep learning, Optimization",rJPcZ3txx,park|faster_cnns_with_direct_sparse_convolutions_and_guided_pruning,Faster CNNs with Direct Sparse Convolutions and Guided Pruning,"Highly-performance sparse convolution outperforms dense with only 70% sparsity.

"Sparse coding represents a signal by a linear combination of only a few atoms of a learned over-complete dictionary. While sparse coding exhibits compelling performance for various machine learning tasks, the process of obtaining sparse code with fixed dictionary is independent for each data point without considering the geometric information and manifold structure of the entire data. We propose Support Regularized Sparse Coding (SRSC) which produces sparse codes that account for the manifold structure of the data by encouraging nearby data in the manifold to choose similar dictionary atoms. In this way, the obtained support regularized sparse codes capture the locally linear structure of the data manifold and enjoy robustness to data noise. We present the optimization algorithm of SRSC with theoretical guarantee for the optimization over the sparse codes. We also propose a feed-forward neural network termed Deep Support Regularized Sparse Coding (Deep-SRSC) as a fast encoder to approximate the sparse codes generated by SRSC.

"Music theory studies the regularity of patterns in music to capture concepts underlying music styles and composers' decisions. This paper continues the study of building \emph{automatic theorists} (rovers) to learn and represent music concepts that lead to human interpretable knowledge and further lead to materials for educating people. Our previous work took a first step in algorithmic concept learning of tonal music, studying high-level representations (concepts) of symbolic music (scores) and extracting interpretable rules for composition. This paper further studies the representation \emph{hierarchy} through the learning process, and supports \emph{adaptive} 2D memory selection in the resulting language model. This leads to a deeper-level interpretability that expands from individual rules to a dynamic system of rules, making the entire rule learning process more cognitive. The outcome is a new rover, MUS-ROVER \RN{2}, trained on Bach's chorales, which outputs customizable syllabi for learning compositional rules. We demonstrate comparable results to our music pedagogy, while also presenting the differences and variations. In addition, we point out the rover's potential usages in style recognition and synthesis, as well as applications beyond music.","haiziyu7@illinois.edu, varshney@illinois.edu","Haizi Yu, Lav R.

"Probabilistic models with discrete latent variables naturally capture datasets composed of discrete classes. However, they are difficult to train efficiently, since backpropagation through discrete variables is generally not possible. We present a novel method to train a class of probabilistic models with discrete latent variables using the variational autoencoder framework, including backpropagation through the discrete latent variables. The associated class of probabilistic models comprises an undirected discrete component and a directed hierarchical continuous component. The discrete component captures the distribution over the disconnected smooth manifolds induced by the continuous component.

"Vector representations of words have heralded a transformational approach to classical problems in NLP; the most popular example is word2vec. However, a single vector does not suffice to model the polysemous nature of many (frequent) words, i.e., words with multiple meanings.    In this paper, we propose a three-fold approach for unsupervised polysemy modeling: (a) context representations, (b) sense induction and disambiguation and (c) lexeme (as a word and sense pair) representations. A key feature of our work is the finding that  a sentence containing a target word is  well represented by a low-rank subspace,  instead of a point in a vector  space. We then show that the subspaces associated with a particular sense of the target word tend to intersect over a line (one-dimensional subspace), which we use to disambiguate senses using a  clustering algorithm that harnesses the Grassmannian geometry of the representations. The disambiguation algorithm, which we call $K$-Grassmeans, leads to a procedure to label the different senses of the target word in the corpus -- yielding lexeme vector representations, all in an unsupervised manner starting from a large (Wikipedia) corpus in English. Apart from several prototypical target (word,sense) examples and a host of empirical studies to intuit and justify  the various geometric representations,  we validate our algorithms on standard sense induction and disambiguation datasets and present new state-of-the-art results.","jiaqimu2@illinois.edu, spbhat2@illinois.edu, pramodv@illinois.edu","Jiaqi Mu, Suma Bhat, Pramod Viswanath",illinois.edu,Natural language processing,HJpfMIFll,mu|geometry_of_polysemy,Geometry of Polysemy,,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJpfMIFll&noteId=HJpfMIFll,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJpfMIFll

We test our framework on two types of tracking data, fruit fly behavior and online handwriting. Our results show that 1) taking advantage of unlabeled sequences, by predicting future motion, significantly improves action detection performance when training labels are scarce, 2) the network learns to represent high level phenomena such as writer identity and fly gender, without supervision, and 3) simulated motion trajectories, generated by treating motion prediction as input to the network, look realistic and may be used to qualitatively evaluate whether the model has learnt generative control rules.","eeyjolfs@caltech.edu, bransonk@janelia.hhmi.org, yyue@caltech.edu, perona@caltech.edu","Eyrun Eyjolfsdottir, Kristin Branson, Yisong Yue, Pietro Perona","caltech.edu, janelia.hhmi.org, disneyresearch.com, cmu.edu, cornell.edu","Unsupervised Learning, Semi-Supervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Applications",BkLhzHtlg,eyjolfsdottir|learning_recurrent_representations_for_hierarchical_behavior_modeling,Learning Recurrent Representations for Hierarchical Behavior Modeling,,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg&noteId=BkLhzHtlg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BkLhzHtlg
"Adversarial examples are malicious inputs designed to fool machine learning models.
They often transfer from one model to another, allowing attackers to mount black
box attacks without knowledge of the target model's parameters.
Adversarial training is the process of explicitly training a model on adversarial
examples, in order to make it more robust to attack or to reduce its test error
on clean inputs.
So far, adversarial training has primarily been applied to small problems.
In this research, we apply adversarial training to ImageNet.
Our contributions include:
(1) recommendations for how to succesfully scale adversarial training to large models and datasets,
(2) the observation that adversarial training confers robustness to single-step attack methods,
(3) the finding that multi-step attack methods are somewhat less transferable than single-step attack
      methods, so single-step attacks are the best for mounting black-box attacks,
      and
(4) resolution of a ``label leaking'' effect that causes adversarially trained models to perform
      better on adversarial examples than on clean examples, because the adversarial
      example construction process uses the true label and the model can learn to
      exploit regularities in the construction process.","kurakin@google.com, ian@openai.com, bengio@google.com","Alexey Kurakin, Ian J.

"It is a surprising fact that electronic medical records are failing at one of their primary purposes, that of tracking the set of medications that the patient is actively taking. Studies estimate that up to 50% of such lists omit active drugs, and that up to 25% of all active medications do not appear on the appropriate patient list. Manual efforts to maintain these lists involve a great deal of tedious human labor, which could be reduced by computational tools to suggest likely missing or incorrect medications on a patient’s list. We report here an application of recurrent neural networks to predict the likely therapeutic classes of medications that a patient is taking, given a sequence of the last 100 billing codes in their record. Our best model was a GRU that achieved high prediction accuracy (micro-averaged AUC 0.93, Label Ranking Loss 0.076), limited by hardware constraints on model size. Additionally, examining individual cases revealed that many of the predictions marked incorrect were likely to be examples of either omitted medications or omitted billing codes, supporting our assertion of a substantial number of errors and omissions in the data, and the likelihood of models such as these to help correct them.","jacek.m.bajor@vanderbilt.edu, tom.lasko@vanderbilt.edu","Jacek M.

"In many computer vision tasks, the relevant information to solve the problem at hand is mixed to irrelevant, distracting information. This has motivated researchers to design attentional models that can dynamically focus on parts of images or videos that are salient, e.g., by down-weighting irrelevant pixels. In this work, we propose a spatiotemporal attentional model that learns where to look in a video directly from human fixation data. We model visual attention with a mixture of Gaussians at each frame. This distribution is used to express the probability of saliency for each pixel. Time consistency in videos is modeled hierarchically by: 1) deep 3D convolutional features to represent spatial and short-term time relations and 2) a long short-term memory network on top that aggregates the clip-level representation of sequential clips and therefore expands the temporal domain from few frames to seconds. The parameters of the proposed model are optimized via maximum likelihood estimation using human fixations as training data, without knowledge of the action in each video. Our experiments on Hollywood2 show state-of-the-art performance on saliency prediction for video. We also show that  our attentional model trained on Hollywood2 generalizes well to UCF101 and it can be leveraged to improve action classification accuracy on both datasets.","loris.bazzani@gmail.com, hugo.larochelle@usherbrooke.ca, lt@dartmouth.edu","Loris Bazzani, Hugo Larochelle, Lorenzo Torresani","dartmouth.edu, amazon.com, twitter.com, usherbrooke.ca, umontreal.ca, google.com, fb.com","Computer vision, Deep learning, Applications",SJRpRfKxx,bazzani|recurrent_mixture_density_network_for_spatiotemporal_visual_attention,Recurrent Mixture Density Network for Spatiotemporal Visual Attention,,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx&noteId=SJRpRfKxx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJRpRfKxx
"Our formal understanding of the inductive bias that drives the success of convolutional networks on computer vision tasks is limited. In particular, it is unclear what makes hypotheses spaces born from convolution and pooling operations so suitable for natural images. In this paper we study the ability of convolutional networks to model correlations among regions of their input. We theoretically analyze convolutional arithmetic circuits, and empirically validate our findings on other types of convolutional networks as well. Correlations are formalized through the notion of separation rank, which for a given partition of the input, measures how far a function is from being separable. We show that a polynomially sized deep network supports exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while being limited to polynomial separation ranks for others. The network's pooling geometry effectively determines which input partitions are favored, thus serves as a means for controlling the inductive bias. Contiguous pooling windows as commonly employed in practice favor interleaved partitions over coarse ones, orienting the inductive bias towards the statistics of natural images. Other pooling schemes lead to different preferences, and this allows tailoring the network to data that departs from the usual domain of natural imagery. In addition to analyzing deep networks, we show that shallow ones support only linear separation ranks, and by this gain insight into the benefit of functions brought forth by depth - they are able to efficiently model strong correlation under favored partitions of the input.","cohennadav@cs.huji.ac.il, shashua@cs.huji.ac.il","Nadav Cohen, Amnon Shashua",cs.huji.ac.il,"Theory, Deep learning",BkVsEMYel,cohen|inductive_bias_of_deep_convolutional_networks_through_pooling_geometry,Inductive Bias of Deep Convolutional Networks through Pooling Geometry,"We study the ability of convolutional networks to model correlations among regions of their input, showing that this is controlled by shapes of pooling windows.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel&noteId=BkVsEMYel,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BkVsEMYel

"Recently deep neural networks have received considerable attention due to their ability to extract and represent high-level abstractions in data sets. Deep neural networks such as fully-connected and convolutional neural networks have shown excellent performance on a wide range of recognition and classification tasks. However, their hardware implementations currently suffer from large silicon area and high power consumption due to the their high degree of complexity. The power/energy consumption of neural networks is dominated by memory accesses, the majority of which occur in fully-connected networks. In fact, they contain most of the deep neural network parameters. In this paper, we propose sparsely-connected networks, by showing that the number of connections in fully-connected networks can be reduced by up to 90% while improving the accuracy performance on three popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN). We then propose an efficient hardware architecture based on linear-feedback shift registers to reduce the memory requirements of the proposed sparsely-connected networks. The proposed architecture can save up to 90% of memory compared to the conventional implementations of fully-connected neural networks. Moreover, implementation results show up to 84% reduction in the energy consumption of a single neuron of the proposed sparsely-connected networks compared to a single neuron of fully-connected neural networks.","arash.ardakani@mail.mcgill.ca, carlo.condo@mail.mcgill.ca, warren.gross@mcgill.ca","Arash Ardakani, Carlo Condo, Warren J.

"There is a lot of research interest in encoding variable length sentences into fixed
length vectors, in a way that preserves the sentence meanings. Two common
methods include representations based on averaging word vectors, and representations based on the hidden states of recurrent neural networks such as LSTMs.
The sentence vectors are used as features for subsequent machine learning tasks
or for pre-training in the context of deep learning. However, not much is known
about the properties that are encoded in these sentence representations and about
the language information they capture.
We propose a framework that facilitates better understanding of the encoded representations. We define prediction tasks around isolated aspects of sentence structure (namely sentence length, word content, and word order), and score representations by the ability to train a classifier to solve each prediction task when

Recent neural network sequence models with softmax classifiers have achieved their best language modeling performance only with very large hidden states and large vocabularies. Even then they struggle to predict rare or unseen words even if the context makes the prediction unambiguous. We introduce the pointer sentinel mixture architecture for neural sequence models which has the ability to either reproduce a word from the recent context or produce a word from a standard softmax classifier. Our pointer sentinel-LSTM model achieves state of the art language modeling performance on the Penn Treebank (70.9 perplexity) while using far fewer parameters than a standard softmax LSTM. In order to evaluate how well language models can exploit longer contexts and deal with more realistic vocabularies and corpora we also introduce the freely available WikiText corpus.,"smerity@salesforce.com, cxiong@salesforce.com, james.bradbury@salesforce.com, rsocher@salesforce.com","Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, Richard Socher",salesforce.com,"Natural language processing, Deep learning",Byj72udxe,merity|pointer_sentinel_mixture_models,Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models,"Pointer sentinel mixture models provide a method to combine a traditional vocabulary softmax with a pointer network, providing state of the art results in language modeling on PTB and the newly introduced WikiText with few extra parameters.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe&noteId=Byj72udxe,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Byj72udxe
"We present an approach to training neural networks to generate sequences using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). Current log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem by introducing a textit{critic} network that is trained to predict the value of an output token, given the policy of an textit{actor} network. This results in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the traditional RL setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation. Our analysis paves the way for such methods to be applied in natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, caption generation, and dialogue modelling.","dimabgv@gmail.com, pbpop3@gmail.com, iamkelvinxu@gmail.com, anirudhgoyal9119@gmail.com, lowe.ryan.t@gmail.com, jpineau@cs.mcgill.ca, aaron.courville@gmail.com, yoshua.bengio@gmail.com","Dzmitry Bahdanau, Philemon Brakel, Kelvin Xu, Anirudh Goyal, Ryan Lowe, Joelle Pineau, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengio","umontreal.ca, google.com, mcgill.ca","Natural language processing, Deep learning, Reinforcement Learning, Structured prediction",SJDaqqveg,bahdanau|an_actorcritic_algorithm_for_sequence_prediction,An Actor-Critic Algorithm for Sequence Prediction,Adapting Actor-Critic methods from reinforcement learning to structured prediction,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJDaqqveg&noteId=SJDaqqveg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJDaqqveg
"Sparse coding is a core building block in many data analysis and machine learning pipelines. Typically it is solved by relying on generic optimization techniques, such as the Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm and its accelerated version (ISTA, FISTA). These methods are optimal in the class of first-order methods for non-smooth, convex functions. However, they do not exploit the particular structure of the problem at hand nor the input data distribution. An acceleration using neural networks, coined LISTA, was proposed in \cite{Gregor10}, which showed empirically that one could achieve high quality estimates with few iterations by modifying the parameters of the proximal splitting appropriately.

In this paper we study the reasons for such acceleration. Our mathematical analysis reveals that it is related to a specific matrix factorization of the Gram kernel of the dictionary, which attempts to nearly diagonalise the kernel with a basis that produces a small perturbation of the $\ell_1$ ball. When this factorization succeeds, we prove that the resulting splitting algorithm enjoys an improved convergence bound with respect to the non-adaptive version. Moreover, our analysis also shows that conditions for acceleration occur mostly at the beginning of the iterative process, consistent with numerical experiments. We further validate our analysis by showing that on dictionaries where this factorization does not exist, adaptive acceleration fails.","thomas.moreau@cmla.ens-cachan.fr, joan.bruna@berkeley.edu","Thomas Moreau, Joan Bruna","cmla.ens-cachan.fr, berkeley.edu, nyu.edu","Theory, Deep learning, Optimization",SJGPL9Dex,moreau|understanding_trainable_sparse_coding_with_matrix_factorization,Understanding Trainable Sparse Coding with Matrix Factorization,"We analyse the mechanisms which permit to accelerate sparse coding resolution using the problem structure, as it is the case in LISTA.",Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGPL9Dex&noteId=SJGPL9Dex,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJGPL9Dex

Updating the upper bound during the optimization leads to improved classification rates while transforming the learning into a sequence of minimization problems.

"Recently there has been much interest in understanding why deep neural networks are preferred to shallow networks. We show that, for a large class of piecewise smooth functions, the number of neurons needed by a shallow network to approximate a function is exponentially larger than the corresponding number of neurons needed by a deep network for a given degree of function approximation. First, we consider univariate functions on a bounded interval and require a neural network to achieve an approximation error of $\varepsilon$ uniformly over the interval. We show that shallow networks (i.e., networks whose depth does not depend on $\varepsilon$) require $\Omega(\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon))$ neurons while deep networks (i.e., networks whose depth grows with $1/\varepsilon$) require $\mathcal{O}(\text{polylog}(1/\varepsilon))$ neurons. We then extend these results to certain classes of important multivariate functions. Our results are derived for neural networks which use a combination of rectifier linear units (ReLUs) and binary step units, two of the most popular type of activation functions. Our analysis builds on a simple observation: the multiplication of two bits can be represented by a ReLU.","sliang26@illinois.edu, rsrikant@illinois.edu","Shiyu Liang, R.

"Learning both hierarchical and temporal representation has been among the long- standing challenges of recurrent neural networks. Multiscale recurrent neural networks have been considered as a promising approach to resolve this issue, yet there has been a lack of empirical evidence showing that this type of models can actually capture the temporal dependencies by discovering the latent hierarchical structure of the sequence. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale approach, called the hierarchical multiscale recurrent neural network, that can capture the latent hierarchical structure in the sequence by encoding the temporal dependencies with different timescales using a novel update mechanism. We show some evidence that the proposed model can discover underlying hierarchical structure in the sequences without using explicit boundary information.

"Dropout, a simple and effective way to train deep neural networks, has led to a number of impressive empirical successes and spawned many recent theoretical investigations. However, the gap between dropout’s training and inference phases, introduced due to tractability considerations, has largely remained under-appreciated. In this work, we first formulate dropout as a tractable approximation of some latent variable model, leading to a clean view of parameter sharing and enabling further theoretical analysis. Then, we introduce (approximate) expectation-linear dropout neural networks, whose inference gap we are able to formally characterize. Algorithmically, we show that our proposed measure of the inference gap can be used to regularize the standard dropout training objective, resulting in an explicit control of the gap. Our method is as simple and efficient as standard dropout. We further prove the upper bounds on the loss in accuracy due to expectation-linearization, describe classes of input distributions that expectation-linearize easily. Experiments on three image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that reducing the inference gap can indeed improve the performance consistently.","xuezhem@cs.cmu.edu, yingkaig@cs.cmu.edu, zhitinghu@cs.cmu.edu, yaoliang@cs.cmu.edu, dengyuntian@gmail.com, hovy@cmu.edu","Xuezhe Ma, Yingkai Gao, Zhiting Hu, Yaoliang Yu, Yuntian Deng, Eduard Hovy",cs.cmu.edu,"Theory, Deep learning, Supervised Learning",rkGabzZgl,ma|dropout_with_expectationlinear_regularization,Dropout with Expectation-linear Regularization,,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl&noteId=rkGabzZgl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkGabzZgl

We demonstrate that such a network generalizes across a diversity of artistic styles by reducing a painting to a point in an embedding space. Importantly, this model permits a user to explore new painting styles by arbitrarily combining the styles learned from individual paintings. We hope that this work provides a useful step towards building rich models of paintings and offers a window on to the structure of the learned representation of artistic style.","vi.dumoulin@gmail.com, shlens@google.com, keveman@google.com","Vincent Dumoulin, Jonathon Shlens, Manjunath Kudlur","google.com, umontreal.ca","Computer vision, Deep learning",BJO-BuT1g,dumoulin|a_learned_representation_for_artistic_style,A Learned Representation For Artistic Style,A deep neural network to learn and combine artistic styles.,Accept (Poster),https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJO-BuT1g&noteId=BJO-BuT1g,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07629.pdf

"Automatically evaluating the quality of dialogue responses for unstructured domains is a challenging problem.
Unfortunately, existing automatic evaluation metrics are biased and correlate very poorly with human judgements of response quality (Liu et al., 2016). Yet having an accurate automatic evaluation procedure is crucial for dialogue research, as it allows rapid prototyping and testing of new models with fewer expensive human evaluations. In response to this challenge, we formulate automatic dialogue evaluation as a learning problem. We present an evaluation model (ADEM) that learns to predict human-like scores to input responses, using a new dataset of human response scores. We show that the ADEM model's predictions correlate significantly, and at level much higher than word-overlap metrics such as BLEU, with human judgements at both the utterance and system-level. We also show that ADEM can generalize to evaluating dialogue models unseen during training, an important step for automatic dialogue evaluation.","rlowe1@cs.mcgill.ca, michael.noseworthy@mail.mcgill.ca, julianserban@gmail.com, nicolas.angelard-gontier@mail.mcgill.ca, yoshua.umontreal@gmail.com, jpineau@cs.mcgill.ca","Ryan Lowe, Michael Noseworthy, Iulian V.

"Reward function design and exploration time are arguably the biggest obstacles to the deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the real world. In many real-world tasks, designing a suitable reward function takes considerable manual engineering and often requires additional and potentially visible sensors to be installed just to measure whether the task has been executed successfully. Furthermore, many interesting tasks consist of multiple steps that must be executed in sequence. Even when the final outcome can be measured, it does not necessarily provide useful feedback on these implicit intermediate steps or sub-goals.
To address these issues, we propose leveraging the abstraction power of intermediate visual representations learned by deep models to quickly infer perceptual reward functions from small numbers of demonstrations. We present a method that is able to identify the key intermediate steps of a task from only a handful of demonstration sequences, and automatically identify the most discriminative features for identifying these steps. This method makes use of the features in a pre-trained deep model, but does not require any explicit sub-goal supervision. The resulting reward functions, which are dense and smooth, can then be used by an RL agent to learn to perform the task in real-world settings. To evaluate the learned reward functions, we present qualitative results on two real-world tasks and a quantitative evaluation against a human-designed reward function. We also demonstrate that our method can be used to learn a complex real-world door opening skill using a real robot, even when the demonstration used for reward learning is provided by a human using their own hand. To our knowledge, these are the first results showing that complex robotic manipulation skills can be learned directly and without supervised labels from a video of a human performing the task.","sermanet@google.com, kelvinxx@google.com, slevine@google.com","Pierre Sermanet, Kelvin Xu, Sergey Levine","google.com, berkeley.edu, washington.edu","Computer vision, Deep learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Transfer Learning",Bkul3t9ee,sermanet|unsupervised_perceptual_rewards_for_imitation_learning,Unsupervised Perceptual Rewards for Imitation Learning,Real robots learn new tasks from observing a few human demonstrations.,Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkul3t9ee&noteId=Bkul3t9ee,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Bkul3t9ee
"Adversarial samples are maliciously created inputs that lead a learning-based classifier to produce incorrect output labels. An adversarial sample is often generated by adding adversarial perturbation (AP) to a normal test sample. Recent studies that tried to analyze classifiers under such AP are mostly empirical and provide little understanding of why. To fill this gap, we propose a theoretical framework for analyzing learning-based classifiers, especially deep neural networks (DNN) in the face of such AP. By using concepts from topology, this framework brings forth the key reasons why an adversarial can fool a  classifier ($f_1$) and suggests a new focus on its oracle ($f_2$, like human annotators of that specific task). By investigating the topology relationship between two (pseudo)metric spaces corresponding to predictor $f_1$ and oracle $f_2$, we develop several ideal conditions that can determine if $f_1$ is always robust (strong-robust) against adversarial samples according to its $f_2$. The theoretical framework leads to a set of novel and complementary insights that have not been uncovered by the literature. Surprisingly our theorems find that just one extra irrelevant feature can make a classifier not strong-robust, and the right feature representation learning is the key to getting a classifier that is both accurate and strong robust. Empirically we find that ""Siamese architecture"" can be used to help DNN models get close to the desired topological relationship for strong-robustness, which in turn effectively improves its performance against AP.","bw4mw@virginia.edu, jg6yd@virginia.edu, yanjun@virginia.edu","Beilun Wang, Ji Gao, Yanjun Qi","virginia.edu, nju.edu.cn, sjtu.edu.cn;nec-labs.com",Deep learning,SywUHFcge,wang|_a_theoretical_framework_for_robustness_of_deep_classifiers_against_adversarial_samples, A Theoretical Framework for Robustness of (Deep) Classifiers against Adversarial Samples,We propose a theoretical framework to explain and measure model robustness and harden DNN model against adversarial attacks.,Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge&noteId=SywUHFcge,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SywUHFcge

"There are families of neural networks that can learn to compute any function, provided sufficient training data. However, given that in practice training data is scarce for all but a small set of problems, a core question is how to incorporate prior knowledge into a model. Here we consider the case of prior procedural knowledge, such as knowing the overall recursive structure of a sequence transduction program or the fact that a program will likely use arithmetic operations on real numbers to solve a task. To this end we present a differentiable interpreter for the programming language Forth. Through a neural implementation of the dual stack machine that underlies Forth, programmers can write program sketches with slots that can be filled with behaviour trained from program input-output data. As the program interpreter is end-to-end differentiable, we can optimize this behaviour directly through gradient descent techniques on user specified objectives, and also integrate the program into any larger neural computation graph. We show empirically that our interpreter is able to effectively leverage different levels of prior program structure and learn complex transduction tasks such as sequence sorting or addition with substantially less data and better generalisation over problem sizes. In addition, we introduce neural program optimisations based on symbolic computation and parallel branching that lead to significant speed improvements.","m.bosnjak@cs.ucl.ac.uk, t.rocktaschel@cs.ucl.ac.uk, j.narad@cs.ucl.ac.uk, s.riedel@cs.ucl.ac.uk","Matko Bošnjak, Tim Rocktäschel, Jason Naradowsky, Sebastian Riedel","cs.ucl.ac.uk, ucl.ac.uk",,HkJq1Ocxl,bonjak|programming_with_a_differentiable_forth_interpreter,Programming With a Differentiable Forth Interpreter,"This paper presents the first neural implementation of an abstract machine for an actual language, allowing programmers to inject prior procedural knowledge into neural architectures in a straightforward manner.",Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkJq1Ocxl&noteId=HkJq1Ocxl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HkJq1Ocxl
"We quantify a source of ineffectual computations when processing the multiplications of the convolutional layers in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and propose Pragrmatic (PRA), an architecture that exploits it improving performance and energy efficiency. 
The source of these ineffectual computations is best understood in the context of conventional multipliers which generate internally multiple terms, that is, products of the multiplicand and powers of two, which added together produce the final product. At runtime, many of these terms are zero as they are generated when the multiplicand is combined with the zero-bits of the multiplicator. While conventional bit-parallel multipliers calculate all terms in parallel to reduce individual product latency, PRA calculates only the non-zero terms resulting in a design whose execution time for convolutional layers is ideally proportional to the number of activation bits that are 1. Measurements demonstrate that for the convolutional layers on Convolutional Neural Networks and during inference, PRA improves performance by 4.3x over the DaDiaNao (DaDN) accelerator and by 4.5x when DaDN uses an 8-bit quantized representation.

In the simplest case, if one has access to pairs of the form (x, y) where y = g(x), the problem can be framed as a regression problem. Beyond this family of problems, we find many cases where the unavailability of data pairs makes this approach unfeasible. However, similar to what we find in the reinforcement learning literature, if we have some known properties of the function we are seeking to approximate, there is still hope to frame the problem as a regression problem. In this context, we present an algorithm that approximates the solution to a partial differential equation known as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs PDE and compare it to current state of the art tools. This PDE, which is found in the fields of control theory and robotics, is of particular importance in safety critical systems where guarantees of performance are a must.","vrubies@berkeley.edu, tomlin@berkeley.edu","Vicenç Rubies Royo, Claire Tomlin",berkeley.edu,"Supervised Learning, Games, Theory",HJTXaw9gx,royo|recursive_regression_with_neural_networks_approximating_the_hji_pde_solution,Recursive Regression with Neural Networks: Approximating the HJI PDE Solution,A neural network that learns an approximation to a function by generating its own regression points,Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJTXaw9gx&noteId=HJTXaw9gx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJTXaw9gx

Currently, state-of-the-art deep networks treat choice of activation function as a hyper-parameter before training. By allowing activation functions to be estimated as part of the training procedure, we expand the class of functions that each node in the network can learn. We also provide a theoretical justification for our choice of nonparametric activation functions and demonstrate that networks with our nonparametric activation functions generalize well. To demonstrate the power of our novel techniques, we test them on image recognition datasets and achieve up to a 15% relative increase in test performance compared to the baseline.","eisenach@princeton.edu, zhaoran@princeton.edu, hanliu@princeton.edu","Carson Eisenach, Zhaoran Wang, Han Liu",princeton.edu,,H1wgawqxl,eisenach|nonparametrically_learning_activation_functions_in_deep_neural_nets,Nonparametrically Learning Activation Functions in Deep Neural Nets,A new class of nonparametric activation functions for deep learning with theoretical guarantees for generalization error.,Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1wgawqxl&noteId=H1wgawqxl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H1wgawqxl
"Humans learn a predictive model of the world and use this model to reason about future events and the consequences of actions. In contrast to most machine predictors, we exhibit an impressive ability to generalize to unseen scenarios and reason intelligently in these settings.  One important aspect of this ability is physical intuition(Lake et al., 2016). In this work, we explore the potential of unsupervised learning to find features that promote better generalization to settings outside the supervised training distribution.  Our task is predicting the stability of towers of square blocks. We demonstrate that an unsupervised model, trained to predict future frames of a video sequence of stable and unstable block configurations, can yield features that support extrapolating stability prediction to blocks configurations outside the training set distribution","memirzamo@gmail.com, aaron.courville@gmail.com, yoshua.umontreal@gmail.com","Mehdi Mirza, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengio","umontreal.ca, google.com","Unsupervised Learning, Deep learning",rJ6DhP5xe,mirza|generalizable_features_from_unsupervised_learning,Generalizable Features From Unsupervised Learning,Using generated data from a next frame predictor model to make a supervised model generalize better to unseen distributions.,Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe&noteId=rJ6DhP5xe,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJ6DhP5xe

"Modeling interactions between features improves the performance of machine learning solutions in many domains (e.g. recommender systems or sentiment analysis). In this paper, we introduce Exponential Machines (ExM), a predictor that models all interactions of every order. The key idea is to represent an exponentially large tensor of parameters in a factorized format called Tensor Train (TT). The Tensor Train format regularizes the model and lets you control the number of underlying parameters. To train the model, we develop a stochastic Riemannian optimization procedure, which allows us to fit tensors with 2^160 entries.

"We consider structure discovery of undirected graphical models from observational data. Inferring likely structures from few examples is a complex task often requiring the formulation of priors and sophisticated inference procedures. In the setting of Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) a popular estimator is a maximum likelihood objective with a penalization on the precision matrix. Adapting this estimator to capture domain-specific knowledge as priors or a new data likelihood requires great effort. In addition, structure recovery is an indirect consequence of the data-fit term. By contrast, it may be easier to generate training samples of data that arise from graphs with the desired structure properties. We propose here to leverage this latter source of information as training data to learn a function mapping from empirical covariance matrices to estimated graph structures.  Learning this function brings two benefits: it implicitly models the desired structure or sparsity properties to form suitable priors, and it can be tailored to the specific problem of edge structure discovery, rather than maximizing data likelihood. We apply this framework to several real-world problems in structure discovery and show that it can be competitive to standard approaches such as graphical lasso, at a fraction of the execution speed. We use convolutional neural networks to parametrize our estimators due to the compositional structure of the problem. Experimentally, our learnable graph-discovery method trained on synthetic data generalizes well to different data: identifying relevant edges in real data, completely unknown at training time. We find that on genetics, brain imaging, and simulation data we obtain competitive(and generally superior) performance, compared with analytical methods.","eugene.belilovsky@inria.fr, kyle.kastner@umontreal.ca, gael.varoquaux@inria.fr, matthew.blaschko@esat.kuleuven.be","Eugene Belilovsky, Kyle Kastner, Gael Varoquaux, Matthew B.

As an application of our method, we propose an amortized MLE algorithm for training deep energy model, where a neural sampler is adaptively trained to approximate the likelihood function.

Scores are also enhanced by FCT pretraining, with a relative gain of +7.8% of Mean Average Precision on birds,  and +2.3% of vowel accuracy against raw audio CNN.

"In this paper, we use dynamical system to analyze the nonlinear weight dynamics of two-layered bias-free networks in the form of $g(x; w) = \sum_{j=1}^K \sigma(w_j \cdot x)$, where $\sigma(\cdot)$ is ReLU nonlinearity. We assume that the input $x$ follow Gaussian distribution. The network is trained using gradient descent to mimic the output of a teacher network of the same size with fixed parameters $w*$ using $l_2$ loss. We first show that when $K = 1$, the nonlinear dynamics can be written in close form, and converges to $w*$ with at least $(1-\epsilon)/2$ probability, if random weight initializations of proper standard derivation ($\sim 1/\sqrt{d}$) is used, verifying empirical practice. For networks with many ReLU nodes ($K \ge 2$), we apply our close form dynamics and prove that when the teacher parameters $\{w*_j\}_{j=1}^K$ forms orthonormal bases, (1) a symmetric weight initialization yields a convergence to a saddle point and (2) a certain symmetry-breaking weight initialization yields global convergence to $w*$ without local minima. To our knowledge, this is the first proof that shows global convergence in nonlinear neural network without unrealistic assumptions on the independence of ReLU activations. In addition, we also give a concise gradient update formulation for a multilayer ReLU network when it follows a teacher of the same size with $l_2$ loss.

"Dataset augmentation, the practice of applying a wide array of domain-specific transformations to synthetically expand a training set, is a standard tool in supervised learning. While effective in tasks such as visual recognition, the set of transformations must be carefully designed, implemented, and tested for every new domain, limiting its re-use and generality. In this paper, we adopt a simpler, domain-agnostic approach to dataset augmentation. We start with existing data points and apply simple transformations such as adding noise, interpolating, or extrapolating between them. Our main insight is to perform the transformation not in input space, but in a learned feature space. A re-kindling of interest in unsupervised representation learning makes this technique timely and more effective. It is a simple proposal, but to-date one that has not been tested empirically. Working in the space of context vectors generated by sequence-to-sequence models, we demonstrate a technique that is effective for both static and sequential data.","terrance@uoguelph.ca, gwtaylor@uoguelph.ca","Terrance DeVries, Graham W.

"Sum-product networks have recently emerged as an attractive representation due to their dual view as a special type of deep neural network with clear semantics and a special type of probabilistic graphical model for which inference is always tractable. Those properties follow from some conditions (i.e., completeness and decomposability) that must be respected by the structure of the network.  As a result, it is not easy to specify a valid sum-product network by hand and therefore structure learning techniques are typically used in practice.

"Modern convolutional networks, incorporating rectifiers and max-pooling, are neither smooth nor convex. Standard guarantees therefore do not apply. Nevertheless, methods from convex optimization such as gradient descent and Adam are widely used as building blocks for deep learning algorithms. This paper provides the first convergence guarantee applicable to modern convnets. The guarantee matches a lower bound for convex nonsmooth functions. The key technical tool is the neural Taylor approximation -- a straightforward application of Taylor expansions to neural networks -- and the associated Taylor loss. Experiments on a range of optimizers, layers, and tasks provide evidence that the analysis accurately captures the dynamics of neural optimization.

The second half of the paper applies the Taylor approximation to isolate the main difficulty in training rectifier nets: that gradients are shattered. We investigate the hypothesis that, by exploring the space of activation configurations more thoroughly, adaptive optimizers such as RMSProp and Adam are able to converge to better solutions.","david.balduzzi@vuw.ac.nz, brian@disneyresearch.com, butlertony@ecs.vuw.ac.nz","David Balduzzi, Brian McWilliams, Tony Butler-Yeoman","mpg.de, ethz.ch, disneyresearch.com, vuw.ac.nz","Deep learning, Optimization, Theory, Supervised Learning",HyWG0H5ge,balduzzi|neural_taylor_approximations_convergence_and_exploration_in_rectifier_networks,Neural Taylor Approximations: Convergence and Exploration in Rectifier Networks,We provide the first convergence result for rectifier neural networks and investigate implications for exploration in shattered landscapes.,Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge&noteId=HyWG0H5ge,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HyWG0H5ge

"The approach of training sequence models using supervised learning and next-step prediction  suffers from known failure modes. For example, it is notoriously difficult to ensure multi-step generated sequences have coherent global structure. We propose a novel sequence-learning approach in which we use a pre-trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to supply part of the reward value in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model. Thus, we can refine a sequence predictor by optimizing for some imposed reward functions, while maintaining good predictive properties learned from data. We propose efficient ways to solve this by augmenting deep Q-learning with a cross-entropy reward and deriving novel off-policy methods for RNNs from KL control. We explore the usefulness of our approach in the context of music generation. An LSTM is trained on a large corpus of songs to predict the next note in a musical sequence. This Note RNN is then refined using our method and rules of music theory. We show that by combining maximum likelihood (ML) and RL in this way, we can not only produce more pleasing melodies, but  significantly reduce unwanted behaviors and failure modes of the RNN, while maintaining information learned from data.","jaquesn@mit.edu, sg717@cam.ac.uk, ret26@cam.ack.uk, deck@google.com","Natasha Jaques, Shixiang Gu, Richard E.

"Our world can be succinctly and compactly described as structured scenes of objects and relations. A typical room, for example, contains salient objects such as tables, chairs and books, and these objects typically relate to each other by virtue of their correlated features, such as position, function and shape. Humans exploit knowledge of objects and their relations for learning a wide spectrum of tasks, and more generally when learning the structure underlying observed data. In this work, we introduce relation networks (RNs) - a general purpose neural network architecture for object-relation reasoning. We show that RNs are capable of learning object relations from scene description data. Furthermore, we show that RNs can act as a bottleneck that induces the factorization of objects from entangled scene description inputs, and from distributed deep representations of scene images provided by a variational autoencoder. The model can also be used in conjunction with differentiable memory mechanisms for implicit relation discovery in one-shot learning tasks.

"Exploration in complex domains is a key challenge in reinforcement learning, especially for tasks with very sparse rewards. Recent successes in deep reinforcement learning have been achieved mostly using simple heuristic exploration strategies such as $\epsilon$-greedy action selection or Gaussian control noise, but there are many tasks where these methods are insufficient to make any learning progress. Here, we consider more complex heuristics: efficient and scalable exploration strategies that maximize a notion of an agent's surprise about its experiences via intrinsic motivation. We propose to learn a model of the MDP transition probabilities concurrently with the policy, and to form intrinsic rewards that approximate the KL-divergence of the true transition probabilities from the learned model. One of our approximations results in using surprisal as intrinsic motivation, while the other gives the $k$-step learning progress. We show that our incentives enable agents to succeed in a wide range of environments with high-dimensional state spaces and very sparse rewards, including continuous control tasks and games in the Atari RAM domain, outperforming several other heuristic exploration techniques.","jachiam@berkeley.edu, sastry@coe.berkeley.edu","Joshua Achiam, Shankar Sastry",berkeley.edu,Reinforcement Learning,Bk8aOm9xl,achiam|surprisebased_intrinsic_motivation_for_deep_reinforcement_learning,Surprise-Based Intrinsic Motivation for Deep Reinforcement Learning,Learn a dynamics model and use it to make your agent boldly go where it has not gone before.,Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8aOm9xl&noteId=Bk8aOm9xl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Bk8aOm9xl
"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an algorithmic framework for constructing generative models with several appealing properties: they do not require a likelihood function to be specified, only a generating procedure; they provide samples that are sharp and compelling; and they allow us to harness our knowledge of building highly accurate neural network classifiers. Here, we develop  our understanding of GANs with the aim of forming a rich view of this growing area of machine learning---to build connections to the diverse set of statistical thinking on this topic, of which much can be gained by a mutual exchange of ideas. We frame GANs within the wider landscape of algorithms for learning in implicit generative models---models that only specify a stochastic procedure with which to generate data---and relate these ideas to modelling problems in related fields, such as econometrics and approximate Bayesian computation. We develop likelihood-free inference methods and highlight hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative models, using which we are able to derive the objective function used by GANs, and many other related objectives. The testing viewpoint directs our focus to the general problem of density ratio estimation. There are four approaches for density ratio estimation, one of which is a solution using classifiers to distinguish real from generated data. Other approaches such as divergence minimisation and moment matching have also been explored in the GAN literature, and we synthesise these views to form an understanding  in terms of the relationships between them and the wider literature, highlighting avenues for future exploration and cross-pollination.","shakir@google.com, balajiln@google.com","Shakir Mohamed, Balaji Lakshminarayanan",google.com,Unsupervised Learning,B16Jem9xe,mohamed|learning_in_implicit_generative_models,Learning in Implicit Generative Models,"Showing connections between GANs, ABC, ratio estimation and other approaches for learning in deep generative models.",Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe&noteId=B16Jem9xe,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B16Jem9xe
"Previous models for video captioning often use the output from a specific layer of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as video representations, preventing them from modeling rich, varying context-dependent semantics in video descriptions. In this paper, we propose a new approach to generating adaptive spatiotemporal representations  of videos for a captioning task.  For this purpose, novel attention mechanisms with spatiotemporal alignment is employed to adaptively and sequentially focus on different layers of CNN features (levels of feature ``abstraction''), as well as local spatiotemporal regions of the feature maps at each layer. Our approach is evaluated on three benchmark datasets: YouTube2Text, M-VAD and MSR-VTT.  Along with visualizing the results and how the model works, these experiments quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive spatiotemporal feature abstraction for translating videos to sentences with rich semantics.","yunchen.pu@duke.edu, renqiang@nec-labs.com, zhe.gan@duke.edu, lcarin@duke.edu","Yunchen Pu, Martin Renqiang Min, Zhe Gan, Lawrence Carin","duke.edu, nec-labs.com, virginia.edu","Computer vision, Deep learning",ByG4hz5le,pu|adaptive_feature_abstraction_for_translating_video_to_language,Adaptive Feature Abstraction for Translating Video to Language,,Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG4hz5le&noteId=ByG4hz5le,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ByG4hz5le
"The universal approximation theorem for neural networks says that any reasonable function is well-approximated by a two-layer neural network with sigmoid gates but it does not provide good bounds on the number of hidden-layer nodes or the weights. However, robust concepts often have small neural networks in practice. We show an efficient analog of the universal approximation theorem on the boolean hypercube in this context.

We prove that any noise-stable boolean function on n boolean-valued input variables can be well-approximated by a two-layer linear threshold circuit with a small number of hidden-layer nodes and small weights, that depend only on the noise-stability and approximation parameters, and are independent of n. We also give a polynomial time learning algorithm that outputs a small two-layer linear threshold circuit that approximates such a given function. We also show weaker generalizations of this to noise-stable polynomial threshold functions and noise-stable boolean functions in general.","amitdesh@microsoft.com, sushrutk@cs.utexas.edu","Amit Deshpande, Sushrut Karmalkar","microsoft.com, cs.utexas.edu",Theory,SyZprb5xg,deshpande|on_robust_concepts_and_small_neural_nets,On Robust Concepts and Small Neural Nets,an efficient analog of the universal approximation theorem for neural networks over the boolean hypercube,Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg&noteId=SyZprb5xg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyZprb5xg
"Deep Convolutional Neuronal Networks (DCNNs) are showing remarkable performance on many computer vision tasks.  Due to their large parameter space, they require many labeled samples when trained in a supervised setting. The costs of annotating data manually can render the use of DCNNs infeasible.  We present a novel framework called RenderGAN that can generate large amounts of realistic, labeled images by combining a 3D model and the Generative Adversarial Network framework. In our approach, image augmentations (e.g. lighting, background, and detail) are learned from unlabeled data such that the generated images are strikingly realistic while preserving the labels known from the 3D model.  We apply the RenderGAN framework to generate images of barcode-like markers that are attached to honeybees. Training a DCNN on data generated by the RenderGAN yields considerably better performance than training it on various baselines.","leon.sixt@fu-berlin.de, benjamin.wild@fu-berlin.de, tim.landgraf@fu-berlin.de","Leon Sixt, Benjamin Wild, Tim Landgraf",fu-berlin.de,"Unsupervised Learning, Computer vision, Deep learning, Applications",BkGakb9lx,sixt|rendergan_generating_realistic_labeled_data,RenderGAN: Generating Realistic Labeled Data,"We embed a 3D model in the GAN framework to generate realistic, labeled data.",Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkGakb9lx&noteId=BkGakb9lx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BkGakb9lx
"The question of how procedural knowledge is represented and inferred is a fundamental problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Recent work on program induction has proposed neural architectures, based on abstractions like stacks, Turing machines, and interpreters,  that operate on abstract computational machines or on execution traces. But the recursive abstraction that is central to procedural knowledge is perhaps most naturally represented by symbolic representations that have syntactic structure, such as logical expressions and source code. Combining abstract, symbolic reasoning with continuous neural reasoning is a grand challenge of representation learning. As a step in this direction, we propose a new architecture, called neural equivalence networks, for the problem of learning continuous semantic representations of mathematical and logical expressions. These networks are trained to represent semantic equivalence, even of expressions that are syntactically very different. The challenge is that semantic representations must be computed in a syntax-directed manner, because semantics is compositional, but at the same time, small changes in syntax can lead to very large changes in semantics, which can be difficult for continuous neural architectures. We perform an exhaustive evaluation  on the task of checking equivalence on a highly diverse class of symbolic algebraic and boolean expression types, showing that our model significantly outperforms existing architectures.","m.allamanis@ed.ac.uk, pankajan.chanthirasegaran@ed.ac.uk, pkohli@microsoft.com, csutton@ed.ac.uk","Miltiadis Allamanis, Pankajan Chanthirasegaran, Pushmeet Kohli, Charles Sutton","ed.ac.uk, microsoft.com",Deep learning,B1vRTeqxg,allamanis|learning_continuous_semantic_representations_of_symbolic_expressions,Learning Continuous Semantic Representations of Symbolic Expressions,"Assign continuous vectors to logical and algebraic symbolic expressions in such a way that semantically equivalent, but syntactically diverse expressions are assigned to identical (or highly similar) continuous vectors.",Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg&noteId=B1vRTeqxg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1vRTeqxg
"Deep networks are successfully used as classification models yielding state-of-the-art results when trained on a large number of labeled samples. These models, however, are usually much less suited for semi-supervised problems because of their tendency to overfit easily when trained on small amounts of data. In this work we will explore a new training objective that is targeting a semi-supervised regime with only a small subset of labeled data. This criterion is based on a deep metric embedding over distance relations within the set of labeled samples, together with constraints over the embeddings of the unlabeled set. The final learned representations are discriminative in euclidean space, and hence can be used with subsequent nearest-neighbor classification using the labeled samples.","ehoffer@tx.technion.ac.il, nailon@cs.technion.ac.il","Elad Hoffer, Nir Ailon","technion.ac.il, intel.com","Deep learning, Semi-Supervised Learning",r1R5Z19le,hoffer|semisupervised_deep_learning_by_metric_embedding,Semi-supervised deep learning by metric embedding,,Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1R5Z19le&noteId=r1R5Z19le,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1R5Z19le
"In this work we study the problem of network morphism, an effective learning scheme to morph a well-trained neural network to a new one with the network function completely preserved. Different from existing work where basic morphing types on the layer level were addressed, we target at the central problem of network morphism at a higher level, i.e., how a convolutional layer can be morphed into an arbitrary module of a neural network. To simplify the representation of a network, we abstract a module as a graph with blobs as vertices and convolutional layers as edges, based on which the morphing process is able to be formulated as a graph transformation problem. Two atomic morphing operations are introduced to compose the graphs, based on which modules are classified into two families, i.e., simple morphable modules and complex modules. We present practical morphing solutions for both of these two families, and prove that any reasonable module can be morphed from a single convolutional layer. Extensive experiments have been conducted based on the state-of-the-art ResNet on benchmark datasets, and the effectiveness of the proposed solution has been verified.","taowei@buffalo.edu, chw@microsoft.com, chencw@buffalo.edu","Tao Wei, Changhu Wang, Chang Wen Chen","buffalo.edu, microsoft.com","Deep learning, Computer vision",BJRIA3Fgg,wei|modularized_morphing_of_neural_networks,Modularized Morphing of Neural Networks,,Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg&noteId=BJRIA3Fgg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJRIA3Fgg
"Data-independent methods for dimensionality reduction such as random projections, sketches, and feature hashing have become increasingly popular in recent years.  These methods often seek to reduce dimensionality while preserving the hypothesis class, resulting in inherent lower bounds on the size of projected data.  For example, preserving linear separability requires $\Omega(1/\gamma^2)$ dimensions, where $\gamma$ is the margin, and in the case of polynomial functions, the number of required dimensions has an exponential dependence on the polynomial degree.
                                                                                                                                                            
Despite these limitations, we show that the dimensionality can be reduced further while maintaining performance guarantees, using improper learning with a slightly larger hypothesis class. In particular, we show that any sparse polynomial function of a sparse binary vector can be computed from a compact sketch by a single-layer neural network, where the sketch size has a logarithmic dependence on the polynomial degree.
                                                                                                                                                           
A practical consequence is that networks trained on sketched data are compact, and therefore suitable for settings with memory and power constraints. We empirically show that our approach leads to networks with fewer parameters than related methods such as feature hashing, at equal or better performance.","amitdaniely@google.com, nevena@google.com, singer@google.com, kunal@google.com","Amit Daniely, Nevena Lazic, Yoram Singer, Kunal Talwar",google.com,Theory,r1br_2Kge,daniely|short_and_deep_sketching_and_neural_networks,Short and Deep: Sketching and Neural Networks,"For sparse boolean inputs, Neural Networks operating on very short sketches can provably and empirically represent a large class of functions.",Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge&noteId=r1br_2Kge,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1br_2Kge
"We describe a framework for multitask deep reinforcement learning guided by
policy sketches. Sketches annotate each task with a sequence of named subtasks,
providing high-level structural relationships among tasks, but not providing the
detailed guidance required by previous work on learning policy abstractions for
RL (e.g. intermediate rewards, subtask completion signals, or intrinsic motivations).
Our approach associates every subtask with its own modular subpolicy,
and jointly optimizes over full task-specific policies by tying parameters across
shared subpolicies. This optimization is accomplished via a simple decoupled
actor–critic training objective that facilitates learning common behaviors from
dissimilar reward functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a
maze navigation game and a 2-D Minecraft-inspired crafting game. Both games
feature extremely sparse rewards that can be obtained only after completing a
number of high-level subgoals (e.g. escaping from a sequence of locked rooms or
collecting and combining various ingredients in the proper order). Experiments
illustrate two main advantages of our approach. First, we outperform standard
baselines that learn task-specific or shared monolithic policies. Second, our
method naturally induces a library of primitive behaviors that can be recombined

"One of the most important fields in robotics is the optimization of controllers. Currently, robots are often treated as a black box in this optimization process, which is the reason why derivative-free optimization methods such as evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning are omnipresent. When gradient-based methods are used, models are kept small or rely on finite difference approximations for the Jacobian. This method quickly grows expensive with increasing numbers of parameters, such as found in deep learning. We propose an implementation of a modern physics engine, which can differentiate control parameters. This engine is implemented for both CPU and GPU. Firstly, this paper shows how such an engine speeds up the optimization process, even for small problems. Furthermore, it explains why this is an alternative approach to deep Q-learning, for using deep learning in robotics. Finally, we argue that this is a big step for deep learning in robotics, as it opens up new possibilities to optimize robots, both in hardware and software.","Jonas.Degrave@UGent.be, x@UGent.be, Joni.Dambre@UGent.be, Francis.wyffels@UGent.be","Jonas Degrave, Michiel Hermans, Joni Dambre, Francis wyffels",ugent.be,Deep learning,SyEiHNKxx,degrave|a_differentiable_physics_engine_for_deep_learning_in_robotics,A Differentiable Physics Engine for Deep Learning in Robotics,We wrote a framework to differentiate through physics and show that this makes training deep learned controllers for robotics remarkably fast and straightforward,Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx&noteId=SyEiHNKxx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyEiHNKxx
"Convolutional neural networks (convnets) have achieved impressive results on recent computer vision benchmarks. While they benefit from multiple layers that encode nonlinear decision boundaries and a degree of translation invariance, training convnets is a lengthy procedure fraught with local optima. Alternatively, a kernel method that incorporates the compositionality and symmetry of convnets could learn similar nonlinear concepts yet with easier training and architecture selection. We propose compositional kernel machines (CKMs), which effectively create an exponential number of virtual training instances by composing transformed sub-regions of the original ones. Despite this, CKM discriminant functions can be computed efficiently using ideas from sum-product networks. The ability to compose virtual instances in this way gives CKMs invariance to translations and other symmetries, and combats the curse of dimensionality. Just as support vector machines (SVMs) provided a compelling alternative to multilayer perceptrons when they were introduced, CKMs could become an attractive approach for object recognition and other vision problems. In this paper we define CKMs, explore their properties, and present promising results on NORB datasets. Experiments show that CKMs can outperform SVMs and be competitive with convnets in a number of dimensions, by learning symmetries and compositional concepts from fewer samples without data augmentation.","rcg@cs.washington.edu, pedrod@cs.washington.edu","Robert Gens, Pedro Domingos","cs.washington.edu, google.com","Computer vision, Supervised Learning",S1Bm3T_lg,gens|compositional_kernel_machines,Compositional Kernel Machines,We propose a kernel method that combats the curse of dimensionality with an exponential number of virtual training instances efficiently composed from transformed sub-regions of the original ones.,Invite to Workshop Track,https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg&noteId=S1Bm3T_lg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1Bm3T_lg

"Most existing machine learning classifiers are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples.
An adversarial example is a sample of input data which has been modified
very slightly in a way that is intended to cause a machine learning classifier
to misclassify it.
In many cases, these modifications can be so subtle that a human observer does
not even notice the modification at all, yet the classifier still makes a mistake.
Adversarial examples pose security concerns
because they could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems, even if the adversary has no
access to the underlying model.
Up to now, all previous work has assumed a threat model in which the adversary can
feed data directly into the machine learning classifier.
This is not always the case for systems operating in the physical world,
for example those which are using signals from cameras and other sensors as input.
This paper shows that even in such physical world scenarios, machine learning systems are vulnerable
to adversarial examples.
We demonstrate this by feeding adversarial images obtained from a cell-phone camera

There are no additive interactions and so our architecture exactly preserves forward hid-den state activation norm and backwards gradient norm for all time steps, and is provably not affected by vanishing or exploding gradients.

"In computer architecture, near-data processing (NDP) refers to augmenting the memory or the storage with processing power so that it can process the data stored therein. By offloading the computational burden of CPU and saving the need for transferring raw data in its entirety, NDP exhibits a great potential for acceleration and power reduction. Despite this potential, specific research activities on NDP have witnessed only limited success until recently, often owing to performance mismatches between logic and memory process technologies that put a limit on the processing capability of memory. Recently, there have been two major changes in the game, igniting the resurgence of NDP with renewed interest. The first is the success of machine learning (ML), which often demands a great deal of computation for training, requiring frequent transfers of big data. The second is the advent of NAND flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) containing multicore processors that can accommodate extra computation for data processing. Sparked by these application needs and technological support, we evaluate the potential of NDP for ML using a new SSD platform that allows us to simulate in-storage processing (ISP) of ML workloads. Our platform (named ISP-ML) is a full-fledged simulator of a realistic multi-channel SSD that can execute various ML algorithms using the data stored in the SSD. For thorough performance analysis and in-depth comparison with alternatives, we focus on a specific algorithm: stochastic gradient decent (SGD), which is the de facto standard for training differentiable learning machines including deep neural networks. We implement and compare three variants of SGD (synchronous, Downpour, and elastic averaging) using ISP-ML, exploiting the multiple NAND channels for parallelizing SGD. In addition, we compare the performance of ISP and that of conventional in-host processing, revealing the advantages of ISP.

"In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach that makes use of two components; a deep hierarchical feature extractor, and a more traditional clustering algorithm. We train the feature extractor in a purely unsupervised manner using generative adversarial training and, in the process, study the strengths of learning using a generative model as an adversary. We also show that adversarial training as done in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is not sufficient to automatically group data into categorical clusters. Instead, we use a more traditional grouping algorithm, k-means	 clustering, to cluster the features learned using adversarial training. We experiment on three well-known datasets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10. The experiments show that the proposed approach performs similarly to supervised learning approaches, and, might even be better in situations with small amounts of labeled training data and large amounts of unlabeled data.","vittalp@jhu.edu, ayuille1@jhu.edu","Vittal Premachandran, Alan L.

"Count-based exploration algorithms are known to perform near-optimally when used in conjunction with tabular reinforcement learning (RL) methods for solving small discrete Markov decision processes (MDPs). It is generally thought that count-based methods cannot be applied in high-dimensional state spaces, since most states will only occur once.
Recent deep RL exploration strategies are able to deal with high-dimensional continuous state spaces through complex heuristics, often relying on optimism in the face of uncertainty or intrinsic motivation. 

In this work, we describe a surprising finding: a simple generalization of the classic count-based approach can reach near state-of-the-art performance on various high-dimensional and/or continuous deep RL benchmarks. States are mapped to hash codes, which allows to count their occurrences with a hash table. These counts are then used to compute a reward bonus according to the classic count-based exploration theory. We find that simple hash functions can achieve surprisingly good results on many challenging tasks. Furthermore, we show that a domain-dependent learned hash code may further improve these results.

Detailed analysis reveals important aspects of a good hash function: 1) having appropriate granularity and 2) encoding information relevant to solving the MDP. This exploration strategy achieves near state-of-the-art performance on both continuous control tasks and Atari 2600 games, hence providing a simple yet powerful baseline for solving MDPs that require considerable exploration.","hrtang.alex@berkeley.edu, rein.houthooft@ugent.be, djfoote@berkeley.edu, adam.stooke@berkeley.edu, peter@openai.com, rocky@openai.com, joschu@openai.com, filip.deturck@ugent.be, pieter@openai.com","Haoran Tang, Rein Houthooft, Davis Foote, Adam Stooke, Xi Chen, Yan Duan, John Schulman, Filip De Turck, Pieter Abbeel","berkeley.edu, eecs.berkeley.edu, openai.com, ugent.be","Deep learning, Reinforcement Learning, Games",SyOvg6jxx,tang|exploration_a_study_of_countbased_exploration_for_deep_reinforcement_learning,#Exploration: A Study of Count-Based Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning,We improve exploration in deep reinforcement learning by simply hashing states and assigning bonus rewards according to state counts.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx&noteId=SyOvg6jxx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyOvg6jxx
"A recent approach to few-shot classification called matching networks has demonstrated the benefits of coupling metric learning with a training procedure that mimics test. This approach relies on a complicated fine-tuning procedure and an attention scheme that forms a distribution over all points in the support set, scaling poorly with its size. We propose a more streamlined approach, prototypical networks, that learns a metric space in which few-shot classification can be performed by computing Euclidean distances to prototype representations of each class, rather than individual points. Our method is competitive with state-of-the-art one-shot classification approaches while being much simpler and more scalable with the size of the support set. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our approach on the Omniglot and mini-ImageNet datasets. We further demonstrate that a similar idea can be used for zero-shot learning, where each class is described by a set of attributes, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the Caltech UCSD bird dataset.","jsnell@cs.toronto.edu, kswersky@twitter.com, zemel@cs.toronto.edu","Jake Snell, Kevin Swersky, Richard Zemel","toronto.edu, twitter.com","Deep learning, Transfer Learning",B1-Hhnslg,snell|prototypical_networks_for_fewshot_learning,Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning,We learn a metric space in which few-shot classification can be performed by computing Euclidean distances to a single prototype representative of each class.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg&noteId=B1-Hhnslg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1-Hhnslg
"It is well known that it is challenging to train deep neural networks and recurrent neural networks for tasks that exhibit long term dependencies. The vanishing or exploding gradient problem is a well known issue associated with these challenges. One approach to addressing vanishing and exploding gradients is to use either soft or hard constraints on weight matrices so as to encourage or enforce orthogonality. Orthogonal matrices preserve gradient norm during backpropagation and can therefore be a desirable property; however, we find that hard constraints on orthogonality can negatively affect the speed of convergence and model performance. This paper explores the issues of optimization convergence, speed and gradient stability using a variety of different methods for encouraging or enforcing orthogonality. In particular we propose a weight matrix factorization and parameterization strategy through which we we can bound matrix norms and therein control the degree of expansivity induced during backpropagation.","eugene.vorontsov@gmail.com, chiheb.trabelsi@polymtl.ca, samuel.kadoury@polymtl.ca, christopher.pal@polymtl.ca","Eugene Vorontsov, Chiheb Trabelsi, Samuel Kadoury, Chris Pal","umontreal.ca, polymtl.ca",Deep learning,HkuVu3ige,vorontsov|on_orthogonality_and_learning_recurrent_networks_with_long_term_dependencies,On orthogonality and learning recurrent networks with long term dependencies,"While orthogonal matrices improve neural network stability during training, deviating from orthogonality may improve model convergence speed and performance.",Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige&noteId=HkuVu3ige,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HkuVu3ige
"In Evolutionary Biology, species close in the tree of evolution are identified by similar visual features. In computer vision, deep neural networks perform image classification by learning to identify similar visual features. This leads to an interesting question: is it possible to leverage the advantage of deep networks to construct a tree of life? In this paper, we make the first attempt at building the phylogenetic tree diagram by leveraging the high-level features learned by deep neural networks. Our method is based on the intuition that if two species share similar features, then their cross activations in the softmax layer should be high. Based on the deep representation of convolutional neural networks trained for image classification, we build a tree of life for species in the image categories of ImageNet. Further, for species not in the ImageNet categories that are visually similar to some category, the cosine similarity of their activation vectors in the same layer should be high. By applying the inner product similarity of the activation vectors at the last fully connected layer for different species, we can roughly build their tree of life. Our work provides a new perspective to the deep representation and sheds light on possible novel applications of deep representation to other areas like Bioinformatics.","yanwang@hust.edu.cn, brooklet60@hust.edu.cn, jeh@cs.cornell.edu, ys646@cornell.edu","Yan Wang, Kun He, John E.

"Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have become one of the most studied frameworks for unsupervised learning due to their intuitive formulation. They have also been shown to be capable of generating convincing examples in limited domains, such as low-resolution images. However, they still prove difficult to train in practice and tend to ignore modes of the data generating distribution. Quantitatively capturing effects such as mode coverage and more generally the quality of the generative model still remain elusive. We propose Generative Adversarial Parallelization (GAP), a framework in which many GANs or their variants are trained simultaneously, exchanging their discriminators. This eliminates the tight coupling between a generator and discriminator, leading to improved convergence and improved coverage of modes. We also propose an improved variant of the recently proposed Generative Adversarial Metric and show how it can score individual GANs or their collections under the GAP model.","daniel.im@aifounded.com, hma02@uoguelph.ca, ckim07@uoguelph.ca, gwtaylor@uoguelph.ca","Daniel Jiwoong Im, He Ma, Chris Dongjoo Kim, Graham Taylor","umontreal.ca, uoguelph.ca, janelia.hhmi.org",Unsupervised Learning,Sk8J83oee,im|generative_adversarial_parallelization,Generative Adversarial Parallelization,Creating Synergy with Multiple Generative Adversarial Networks,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee&noteId=Sk8J83oee,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sk8J83oee

"In this paper, we study novel neural network structures to better model long term dependency in sequential data. 
We propose to use more memory units to keep track of more preceding states in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are all recurrently fed to the hidden layers as feedback through different weighted paths. By extending the popular
recurrent structure in RNNs, we provide the models with better short-term memory mechanism to learn long term dependency in sequences. Analogous to digital filters in signal processing, we call these structures as higher order RNNs (HORNNs). Similar to RNNs, HORNNs can also be learned using the back-propagation through time method. HORNNs are generally applicable to a variety of sequence modelling tasks. In this work, we have examined HORNNs for the language modeling task using two popular data sets, namely the Penn Treebank (PTB) and English text8. Experimental results have shown that the proposed HORNNs yield the state-of-the-art performance on both data sets, significantly outperforming the regular RNNs as well as the popular LSTMs.","rsoltani@cse.yorku.ca, hj@cse.yorku.ca","Rohollah Soltani, Hui Jiang",cse.yorku.ca,"Deep learning, Natural language processing",ByZvfijeg,soltani|higher_order_recurrent_neural_networks,Higher Order Recurrent Neural Networks,we study novel neural network structures to better model long term dependency in sequential data,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg&noteId=ByZvfijeg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ByZvfijeg
"In this paper, we study deep generative models for effective unsupervised learning. We propose VGAN, which works by minimizing a variational lower bound of the negative log likelihood (NLL) of an energy based model (EBM), where the model density $p(\mathbf{x})$ is approximated by a variational distribution $q(\mathbf{x})$ that is easy to sample from. The training of VGAN takes a two step procedure: given $p(\mathbf{x})$, $q(\mathbf{x})$ is updated to maximize the lower bound; $p(\mathbf{x})$ is then updated one step with samples drawn from $q(\mathbf{x})$ to decrease the lower bound. VGAN is inspired by the generative adversarial networks (GANs), where $p(\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the discriminator and $q(\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the generator, but with several notable differences. We hence name our model variational GANs (VGANs). VGAN provides a practical solution to training deep EBMs in high dimensional space, by eliminating the need of MCMC sampling. From this view, we are also able to identify causes to the difficulty of training GANs and propose viable solutions.","szhai2@binghamton.edu, chengyu@us.ibm.com, rsferis@us.ibm.com, zhongfei@cs.binghamton.edu","Shuangfei Zhai, Yu Cheng, Rogerio Feris, Zhongfei Zhang",binghamton.edu,,ry7O1ssex,zhai|generative_adversarial_networks_as_variational_training_of_energy_based_models,Generative Adversarial Networks as Variational Training of Energy Based Models,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry7O1ssex&noteId=ry7O1ssex,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ry7O1ssex
"One main concern of the deep learning community is to increase the capacity of
representation of deep networks by increasing their depth. This requires to scale
up the size of the training database accordingly. Indeed a major intuition lies in
the fact that the depth of the network and the size of the training set are strongly
correlated. However recent works tend to show that deep learning may be handled
with smaller dataset as long as the training samples are carefully selected (let us
mention for instance curriculum learning). In this context we introduce a scalable
and efficient active learning method that can be applied to most neural networks,
especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). To the best of our knowledge,
this paper is the first of its kind to design an active learning selection scheme based
on a variational inference for neural networks. We also deduced a formulation of
the posterior and prior distributions of the weights using statistical knowledge on
the Maximum Likelihood Estimator.

"Finding relationships between multiple views of data is essential both in exploratory analysis and as pre-processing for predictive tasks. A prominent approach is to apply variants of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), a classical method seeking correlated components between views. The basic CCA is restricted to maximizing a simple dependency criterion, correlation, measured directly between data coordinates. We introduce a new method that finds dependent subspaces of views directly optimized for the data analysis task of neighbor retrieval between multiple views. We optimize mappings for each view such as linear transformations to maximize cross-view similarity between neighborhoods of data samples. The criterion arises directly from the well-defined retrieval task, detects nonlinear and local similarities, measures dependency of data relationships rather than only individual data coordinates, and is related to well understood measures of information retrieval quality. In experiments the proposed method outperforms alternatives in preserving cross-view neighborhood similarities, and yields insights into local dependencies between multiple views.","ziyuan.lin@aalto.fi, jaakko.peltonen@uta.fi","Ziyuan Lin, Jaakko Peltonen","aalto.fi, uta.fi",Unsupervised Learning,Hk-mgcsgx,lin|an_information_retrieval_approach_for_finding_dependent_subspaces_of_multiple_views,An Information Retrieval Approach for Finding Dependent Subspaces of Multiple Views,"A novel method for seeking dependent subspaces across multiple views, preserving neighborhood relationships of data",Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx&noteId=Hk-mgcsgx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Hk-mgcsgx
"Text classification in general is a well studied area. However, classifying short and noisy text remains challenging. Feature sparsity is a major issue. The quality of document representation here has a great impact on the classification accuracy. Existing methods represent text using bag-of-word model, with TFIDF or other weighting schemes. Recently word embedding and even document embedding are proposed to represent text. The purpose is to capture features at both word level and sentence level. However, the character level information are usually ignored. In this paper, we take word morphology and word semantic meaning into consideration, which are represented by character-aware embedding and word distributed embedding. By concatenating both character-level and word distributed embedding together and arranging words in order, a sentence representation matrix could be obtained. To overcome data sparsity problem of short text, sentence representation vector is then derived based on different views from sentence representation matrix. The various views contributes to the construction of an enriched sentence embedding. We employ a residual network on the sentence embedding to get a consistent and refined sentence representation.

"Deep learning methods that extract answers for non-factoid questions from QA sites are seen as critical since they can assist users in reaching their next decisions through conversations with AI systems. The current methods, however, have the following two problems: (1) They can not understand the ambiguous use of words in the questions as word usage can strongly depend on the context (e.g. the word “relationship” has quite different meanings in the categories of Love advice and other categories). As a result, the accuracies of their answer selections are not good enough. (2) The current methods can only select from among the answers held by QA sites and can not generate new ones. Thus, they can not answer the questions that are somewhat different with those stored in QA sites. Our solution, Neural Answer Construction Model, tackles these problems as it: (1) Incorporates the biases of semantics behind questions (e.g. categories assigned to questions) into word embeddings while also computing them regardless of the semantics. As a result, it can extract answers that suit the contexts of words used in the question as well as following the common usage of words across semantics. This improves the accuracy of answer selection. (2) Uses biLSTM to compute the embeddings of questions as well as those of the sentences often used to form answers (e.g. sentences representing conclusions or those supplementing the conclusions). It then simultaneously learns the optimum combination of those sentences as well as the closeness between the question and those sentences. As a result, our model can construct an answer that corresponds to the situation that underlies the question; it fills the gap between answer selection and generation and is the first model to move beyond the current simple answer selection model for non-factoid QAs.

We present three classes of attacks on the VAE and VAE-GAN architectures and demonstrate them against networks trained on MNIST, SVHN and CelebA. Our first attack leverages classification-based adversaries by attaching a classifier to the trained encoder of the target generative model, which can then be used to indirectly manipulate the latent representation. Our second attack directly uses the VAE loss function to generate a target reconstruction image from the adversarial example. Our third attack moves beyond relying on classification or the standard loss for the gradient and directly optimizes against differences in source and target latent representations.

Neural conversation models -- purely data-driven systems trained end-to-end on dialogue corpora -- have shown great promise recently, yet they often produce short and generic responses. This work presents new training and decoding methods that improve the quality, coherence, and diversity of long responses generated using sequence-to-sequence models. Our approach adds self-attention to the decoder to maintain coherence in longer responses, and we propose a practical approach, called the glimpse-model, for scaling to large datasets. We introduce a stochastic beam-search algorithm with segment-by-segment reranking which lets us inject diversity earlier in the generation process. We trained on a combined data set of over 2.3B conversation messages mined from the web. In human evaluation studies, our method produces longer responses overall, with a higher proportion rated as acceptable and excellent as length increases, compared to baseline sequence-to-sequence models with explicit length-promotion. A back-off strategy produces better responses overall, in the full spectrum of lengths.","overmind@google.com, sgouws@google.com, dennybritz@google.com, agoldie@google.com, bps@google.com, raykurzweil@google.com","Louis Shao, Stephan Gouws, Denny Britz, Anna Goldie, Brian Strope, Ray Kurzweil",google.com,"Natural language processing, Deep learning",HJDdiT9gl,shao|generating_long_and_diverse_responses_with_neural_conversation_models,Generating Long and Diverse Responses with Neural Conversation Models,We generate high quality and informative open-domain conversation responses using seq2seq model with target-side attention and stochastic beam search with segment-by-segment reranking.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl&noteId=HJDdiT9gl,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.03185.pdf
"Neural network models have a reputation for being black boxes. We propose a new method to better understand the roles and dynamics of the intermediate layers. This has direct consequences on the design of such models and it enables the expert to be able to justify certain heuristics (such as adding auxiliary losses in middle layers). Our method uses linear classifiers, referred to as ``probes'', where a probe can only use the hidden units of a given intermediate layer as discriminating features. Moreover, these probes cannot affect the training phase of a model, and they are generally added after training. They allow the user to visualize the state of the model at multiple steps of training. We demonstrate how this can be used to develop a better intuition about models and to diagnose potential problems.","guillaume.alain.umontreal@gmail.com, yoshua.bengio@gmail.com","Guillaume Alain, Yoshua Bengio",umontreal.com,,ryF7rTqgl,alain|understanding_intermediate_layers_using_linear_classifier_probes,Understanding intermediate layers using linear classifier probes,New useful concept of information to understand deep learning.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl&noteId=ryF7rTqgl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryF7rTqgl
"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) learn highly discriminative representations from data, but how robust and structured are these representations? How does the data shape the internal network representation? We shed light on these questions by empirically measuring the invariance and equivariance properties of a large number of CNNs trained with various types of input transformations. We find that CNNs learn invariance wrt all 9 tested transformation types and that invariance extends to transformations outside the training range. We also measure the distance between CNN representations and show that similar input transformations lead to more similar internal representations. Transforms can be grouped by the way they affect the learned representation. Additionally, we also propose a loss function that aims to improve CNN equivariance.","tensmeyer@byu.edu, martinez@cs.byu.edu","Christopher Tensmeyer, Tony Martinez",byu.edu,Deep learning,Syfkm6cgx,tensmeyer|improving_invariance_and_equivariance_properties_of_convolutional_neural_networks,Improving Invariance and Equivariance Properties of Convolutional Neural Networks,Data augmentation shapes internal network representation and makes predictions robust to input transformations.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx&noteId=Syfkm6cgx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Syfkm6cgx
"Local trends of time series characterize the intermediate upward and downward patterns of time series. Learning and forecasting the local trend in time series data play an important role in many real applications, ranging from investing in the stock market, resource allocation in data centers and load schedule in smart grid. Inspired by the recent successes of neural networks, in this paper we propose TreNet, a novel end-to-end hybrid neural network that predicts the local trend of time series based on local and global contextual features. TreNet leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract salient features from local raw data of time series. Meanwhile, considering long-range dependencies existing in the sequence of historical local trends, TreNet uses a long-short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) to capture such dependency. Furthermore, for predicting the local trend, a feature fusion layer is designed in TreNet to learn joint representation from the features captured by CNN and LSTM. Our proposed TreNet demonstrates its effectiveness by outperforming conventional CNN, LSTM, HMM method and various kernel based baselines on real datasets.","tao.lin@epfl.ch, tian.guo@epfl.ch, karl.aberer@epfl.ch","Tao Lin, Tian Guo, Karl Aberer",epfl.ch,,ryCcJaqgl,lin|trenet_hybrid_neural_networks_for_learning_the_local_trend_in_time_series,TreNet: Hybrid Neural Networks for Learning the Local Trend in Time Series,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl&noteId=ryCcJaqgl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryCcJaqgl
"The computational mechanisms by which nonlinear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) achieve their goals remains an open question.  There exist many problem domains where intelligibility of the network model is crucial for deployment. Here we introduce a recurrent architecture composed of input-switched affine transformations, in other words an RNN without any nonlinearity and with one set of weights per input.
We show that this architecture achieves near identical performance to traditional architectures on language modeling of Wikipedia text, for the same number of model parameters. 
It can obtain this performance with the potential for computational speedup compared to existing methods, by precomputing the composed affine transformations corresponding to longer input sequences. 
As our architecture is affine, we are able to understand the mechanisms by which it functions using linear methods. For example, we show how the network linearly combines contributions from the past to make predictions at the current time step. We show how representations for words can be combined in order to understand how context is transferred across word boundaries. Finally, we demonstrate how the system can be executed and analyzed in arbitrary bases to aid understanding.","jakob.foerster@cs.ox.ac.uk, gilmer@google.com, jan.chorowski@cs.uni.wroc.pl, jaschasd@google.com, sussillo@google.com","Jakob Foerster, Justin Gilmer, Jan Chorowski, Jascha Sohl-dickstein, David Sussillo","cs.ox.ac.uk, google.com, stanford.edu, cs.uni.wroc.pl","Natural language processing, Deep learning, Supervised Learning",H1MjAnqxg,foerster|intelligible_language_modeling_with_input_switched_affine_networks,Intelligible Language Modeling with Input Switched Affine Networks,Input Switched Affine Networks combine intelligibility with performance for character level language modeling.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1MjAnqxg&noteId=H1MjAnqxg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H1MjAnqxg
"The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility and potential benefits of using a physiological plausible model of handwriting as a feature representation for sequence generation with recurrent mixture density networks. We build on recent results in handwriting prediction developed by Graves (2013), and we focus on generating sequences that possess the statistical and dynamic qualities of handwriting and calligraphic art forms. Rather than model raw sequence data, we first preprocess and reconstruct the input training data with a concise representation given by a motor plan (in the form of a coarse sequence of `ballistic' targets) and corresponding dynamic parameters (which define the velocity and curvature of the pen-tip trajectory). This representation provides a number of advantages, such as enabling the system to learn from very few examples by introducing artificial variability in the training data, and mixing of visual and dynamic qualities learned from different datasets.","d.berio@gold.ac.uk, m.akten@ac.uk, ffl@gold.ac.uk, m.grierson@gold.ac.uk, rejean.plamondon@polymtl.ca","Daniel Berio, Memo Akten, Frederic Fol Leymarie, Mick Grierson, Réjean Plamondon","gold.ac.uk, polymtl.ca","Deep learning, Supervised Learning, Applications",r1S083cgx,berio|sequence_generation_with_a_physiologically_plausible_model_of_handwriting_and_recurrent_mixture_density_networks,Sequence generation with a physiologically plausible model of handwriting and Recurrent Mixture Density Networks,To explore the feasibility and potential benefits of using a physiological plausible model of handwriting as a feature representation for sequence generation with recurrent mixture density networks,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1S083cgx&noteId=r1S083cgx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1S083cgx

"Recent advances in machine learning have brought the field closer to computational creativity research. From a creativity research point of view, this offers the potential to study creativity in relationship with knowledge acquisition. From a machine learning perspective, however, several aspects of creativity need to be better defined to allow the machine learning community to develop and test hypotheses in a systematic way. We propose an actionable definition of creativity as the generation of out-of-distribution novelty. We assess several  metrics designed for evaluating the quality of generative models on this new task. We also propose a new experimental setup. Inspired by the usual held-out validation, we hold out entire classes for evaluating the generative potential of models. The goal of the novelty generator is then to use training classes to build a model that can generate objects from future (hold-out) classes, unknown at training time - and thus, are novel with respect to the knowledge the model incorporates. Through extensive experiments on various types of generative models, we are able to find architectures and hyperparameter combinations which lead to out-of-distribution novelty.","mehdicherti@gmail.com, balazskegl@gmail.com, akin.kazakci@mines-paristech.fr","Mehdi Cherti, Balázs Kégl, Akın Kazakçı",lri.fr,"Deep learning, Unsupervised Learning",ByEPMj5el,cherti|outofclass_novelty_generation_an_experimental_foundation,Out-of-class novelty generation: an experimental foundation,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el&noteId=ByEPMj5el,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ByEPMj5el
"Transfer and multi-task learning have traditionally focused on either a single source-target pair or very few, similar tasks. Ideally, the linguistic levels of morphology, syntax and semantics would benefit each other by being trained in a single model. We introduce such a joint many-task model together with a strategy for successively growing its depth to solve increasingly complex tasks. All layers include shortcut connections to both word representations and lower-level task predictions. We use a simple regularization term to allow for optimizing all model weights to improve one task's loss without exhibiting catastrophic interference of the other tasks. Our single end-to-end trainable model obtains state-of-the-art results on chunking, dependency parsing, semantic relatedness and textual entailment. It also performs competitively on POS tagging.

"Although neural networks are well suited for sequential transfer learning tasks, the catastrophic forgetting problem hinders proper integration of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem by using a multi-task objective based on the idea of distillation and a mechanism that directly penalizes forgetting at the shared representation layer during the knowledge integration phase of training. We demonstrate our approach on a Twitter domain sentiment analysis task with sequential knowledge transfer from four related tasks.  We show that our technique outperforms networks fine-tuned to the target task. Additionally, we show both through empirical evidence and examples that it does not forget useful knowledge from the source task that is forgotten during standard fine-tuning. Surprisingly, we find that first distilling a human made rule based sentiment engine into a recurrent neural network and then integrating the knowledge with the target task data leads to a substantial gain in generalization performance. Our experiments demonstrate the power of multi-source transfer techniques in practical text analytics problems when paired with distillation. In particular, for the SemEval 2016 Task 4 Subtask A (Nakov et al., 2016) dataset we surpass the state of the art established during the competition with a comparatively simple model architecture that is not even competitive when trained on only the labeled task specific data.","mdriemer@us.ibm.com, ekhabiri@us.ibm.com, rgoodwin@us.ibm.com","Matthew Riemer, Elham Khabiri, Richard Goodwin",ibm.com,"Deep learning, Transfer Learning, Natural language processing",HyenWc5gx,riemer|representation_stability_as_a_regularizer_for_improved_text_analytics_transfer_learning,Representation Stability as a Regularizer for Improved Text Analytics Transfer Learning,We propose a novel general purpose regularizer to address catastrophic forgetting in neural network sequential transfer learning.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx&noteId=HyenWc5gx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HyenWc5gx
"The Neural GPU is a recent model that can learn algorithms such as multi-digit binary addition and binary multiplication in a way that generalizes to inputs of arbitrary length.  We show that there are two simple ways of improving the performance of the Neural GPU: by carefully designing a curriculum, and by increasing model size.  The latter requires a memory efficient implementation, as a naive implementation of the Neural GPU is memory intensive.  We find that these techniques increase the set of algorithmic problems that can be solved by the Neural GPU: we have been able to learn to perform all the arithmetic operations (and generalize to arbitrarily long numbers) when the arguments are given in the decimal representation (which, surprisingly, has not been possible before). We have also been able to train the Neural GPU to evaluate long arithmetic expressions with multiple operands that require respecting the  precedence order of the operands, although these have succeeded only in their binary representation, and not with perfect accuracy.

In addition, we gain insight into the Neural GPU by investigating its failure modes.  We find that Neural GPUs that correctly generalize to arbitrarily long numbers still fail to compute the correct answer on highly-symmetric, atypical inputs: for  example, a Neural GPU that achieves near-perfect generalization on decimal multiplication of up to 100-digit long numbers can fail on $000000\dots002 \times 000000\dots002$ while succeeding at $2 \times 2$.  These failure modes are reminiscent of adversarial examples.","ecprice@cs.utexas.edu, woj@openai.com, ilyasu@openai.com","Eric Price, Wojciech Zaremba, Ilya Sutskever","nyu.edu, facebook.com, fb.com, google.com, openai.com, cs.utexas.edu",,ryjp1c9xg,price|extensions_and_limitations_of_the_neural_gpu,Extensions and Limitations of the Neural GPU,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg&noteId=ryjp1c9xg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryjp1c9xg
"Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is a challenging task due to computation complexity and memory intensity. Existing works solve this problem by reducing model size using weight approximation methods based on dimension reduction (i.e., SVD, Tucker decomposition and Quantization). However, the execution speed of these compressed models are still far below the real-time processing requirement of mobile services. To address this limitation, we propose a novel acceleration framework: DeepRebirth by exploring the deep learning model parameter sparsity through merging the parameter-free layers with their neighbor convolution layers to a single dense layer. The design of DeepRebirth is motivated by the key observation: some layers (i.e., normalization and pooling) in deep learning models actually consume a large portion of computational time even few learned parameters are involved, and acceleration of these layers has the potential to improve the processing speed significantly. Essentially, the functionality of several merged layers is replaced by the new dense layer – rebirth layer in DeepRebirth. In order to preserve the same functionality, the rebirth layer model parameters are re-trained to be functionality equivalent to the original several merged layers. The extensive experiments performed on ImageNet using several popular mobile devices demonstrate that DeepRebirth is not only providing huge speed-up in model deployment and significant memory saving but also maintaining the model accuracy, i.e., 3x-5x speed-up and energy saving on GoogLeNet with only 0.4% accuracy drop on top-5 categorization in ImageNet. Further, by combining with other model compression techniques, DeepRebirth offers an average of 65ms model forwarding time on each image using Samsung Galaxy S6 with only 2.4% accuracy drop. In addition, 2.5x run-time memory saving is achieved with rebirth layers.","dal312@lehigh.edu, visionxiaolong@gmail.com, doogkong@gmail.com","Dawei Li, Xiaolong Wang, Deguang Kong, Mooi Choo Chuah","lehigh.edu, samsung.com",,SkwSJ99ex,li|deeprebirth_a_general_approach_for_accelerating_deep_neural_network_execution_on_mobile_devices,DeepRebirth: A General Approach for Accelerating Deep Neural Network Execution on Mobile Devices,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex&noteId=SkwSJ99ex,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SkwSJ99ex
"The detection and identification of extreme weather events in large scale climate simulations is an important problem for risk management, informing governmental policy decisions and advancing our basic understanding of the climate system.
Recent work has shown that fully supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can yield acceptable accuracy for classifying well-known types of extreme weather events when large amounts of labeled data are available. However, there are many different types of spatially localized climate patterns of interest (including hurricanes, extra-tropical cyclones, weather fronts, blocking events, etc.)

"The contribution of each sample during model training varies across training iterations and the model's parameters. We define the concept of sample importance as the change in parameters induced by a sample. In this paper, we explored the sample importance in training deep neural networks using stochastic gradient descent. We found that ""easy"" samples -- samples that are correctly and confidently classified at the end of the training -- shape parameters closer to the output, while the ""hard"" samples impact parameters closer to the input to the network. Further, ""easy"" samples are relevant in the early training stages, and ""hard"" in the late training stage. Further, we show that constructing batches which contain samples of comparable difficulties tends to be a poor strategy compared to maintaining a mix of both hard and easy samples in all of the batches. Interestingly, this contradicts some of the results on curriculum learning which suggest that ordering training examples in terms of difficulty can lead to better performance.","tgao@cs.unc.edu, vjojic@cs.unc.edu","Tianxiang Gao, Vladimir Jojic",cs.unc.edu,"Deep learning, Supervised Learning",r1IRctqxg,gao|sample_importance_in_training_deep_neural_networks,Sample Importance in Training Deep Neural Networks,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg&noteId=r1IRctqxg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1IRctqxg

"Deep generative models provide a powerful and flexible means to learn complex distributions over data by incorporating neural networks into latent-variable models. Variational approaches to training such models introduce a probabilistic encoder that casts data, typically unsupervised, into an entangled and unstructured representation space. While unsupervised learning is often desirable, sometimes even necessary, when we lack prior knowledge about what to represent, being able to incorporate domain knowledge in characterising certain aspects of variation in the data can often help learn better disentangled representations. Here, we introduce a new formulation of semi-supervised learning in variational autoencoders that allows precisely this. It permits flexible specification of probabilistic encoders as directed graphical models via a stochastic computation graph, containing both continuous and discrete latent variables, with conditional distributions parametrised by neural networks. We demonstrate how the provision of structure, along with a few labelled examples indicating plausible values for some components of the latent space, can help quickly learn disentangled representations. We then evaluate its ability to do so, both qualitatively by exploring its generative capacity, and quantitatively by using the disentangled representation to perform classification, on a variety of models and datasets.","nsid@robots.ox.ac.uk, brooks@robots.ox.ac.uk, alban@robots.ox.ac.uk, j.vandemeent@northeastern.edu, fwood@robots.ox.ac.uk, ngoodman@stanford.edu, pkohli@microsoft.com, philip.torr@eng.ox.ac.uk","N.

"Deep learning consists in training neural networks to perform computations that sequentially unfold in many steps over a time dimension or an intrinsic depth dimension. For large depths, this is usually accomplished by specialized network architectures that are designed to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, e.g. LSTMs, GRUs, Highway Networks and Deep Residual Networks, which are based on a single structural principle: the state passthrough. We observe that these ""Passthrough Networks"" architectures enable the decoupling of the network state size from the number of parameters of the network, a possibility that is exploited in some recent works but not thoroughly explored. In this work we propose simple, yet effective, low-rank and low-rank plus diagonal matrix parametrizations for Passthrough Networks which exploit this decoupling property, reducing the data complexity and memory requirements of the network while preserving its memory capacity.

We propose two techniques that alleviate this problem, significantly improving our ability to fit DLGMs to sparse, high-dimensional data. Having fit these models, we are faced with another challenge: how to use and interpret the representation that we have learned?

"Recent studies on knowledge base completion, the task of recovering missing relationships based on recorded relations, demonstrate the importance of learning embeddings from multi-step relations. However, due to the size of knowledge bases, learning multi-step relations directly on top of observed instances could be costly. In this paper, we propose Implicit ReasoNets (IRNs), which is designed to perform large-scale inference implicitly through a search controller and shared memory. Unlike previous work, IRNs use training data to learn to perform multi-step inference through the shared memory, which is also jointly updated during training. While the inference procedure is not operating on top of observed instances for IRNs, our proposed model outperforms all previous approaches on the popular FB15k benchmark by more than 5.7%.","yeshen@microsoft.com, pshuang@microsoft.com, minchang@microsoft.com, jfgao@microsoft.com","Yelong Shen*, Po-Sen Huang*, Ming-Wei Chang, Jianfeng Gao",microsoft.com,"Deep learning, Reinforcement Learning",r1PRvK9el,shen|implicit_reasonet_modeling_largescale_structured_relationships_with_shared_memory,Implicit ReasoNet: Modeling Large-Scale Structured Relationships with Shared Memory,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1PRvK9el&noteId=r1PRvK9el,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1PRvK9el
"This paper presents a framework to tackle combinatorial optimization problems using neural networks and reinforcement learning. We focus on the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and train a recurrent neural network that, given a set of city coordinates, predicts a distribution over different city permutations. Using negative tour length as the reward signal, we optimize the parameters of the recurrent neural network using a policy gradient method. We compare learning the network parameters on a set of training graphs against learning them on individual test graphs. Without much engineering and heuristic designing, Neural Combinatorial Optimization achieves close to optimal results on 2D Euclidean graphs with up to 100 nodes. Applied to the KnapSack, another NP-hard problem, the same method obtains optimal solutions for instances with up to 200 items. These results, albeit still far from state-of-the-art, give insights into how neural networks can be used as a general tool for tackling combinatorial optimization problems.","ibello@google.com, hyhieu@google.com, qvl@google.com, mnorouzi@google.com, bengio@google.com","Irwan Bello*, Hieu Pham*, Quoc V.

"Multivariate time series data in practical applications, such as health care, geoscience, and biology, are characterized by a variety of missing values. In time series prediction and other related tasks, it has been noted that missing values and their missing patterns are often correlated with the target labels, a.k.a., informative missingness. There is very limited work on exploiting the missing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance. In this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of the early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of missing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates them into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term temporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to achieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification tasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and provides useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing values in time series analysis.","zche@usc.edu, spurusho@usc.edu, kyunghyun.cho@nyu.edu, dsontag@cs.nyu.edu, yanliu.cs@usc.edu","Zhengping Che, Sanjay Purushotham, Kyunghyun Cho, David Sontag, Yan Liu","usc.edu, nyu.edu, cs.nyu.edu",Deep learning,BJC8LF9ex,che|recurrent_neural_networks_for_multivariate_time_series_with_missing_values,Recurrent Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series with Missing Values,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC8LF9ex&noteId=BJC8LF9ex,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJC8LF9ex
"Classifying question sentences into their corresponding categories is an important task with wide applications, for example in many websites' FAQ sections. 
However, traditional question classification techniques do not fully utilize the well-prepared answer data which has great potential for improving question sentence representations which could lead to better classification performance. In order to encode answer information into question representation, we first introduce novel group sparse autoencoders which could utilize the group information in the answer set to refine question representation. We then propose a new group sparse convolutional neural network which could naturally learn the question representation with respect to their corresponding answers by implanting the group sparse autoencoders into the traditional convolutional neural network.

"One of the major goals in automated argumentation mining is to uncover the argument structure present in argumentative text. In order to determine this structure, one must understand how different individual components of the overall argument are linked. General consensus in this field dictates that the argument components form a hierarchy of persuasion, which manifests itself in a tree structure. This work provides the first neural network-based approach to argumentation mining, focusing on extracting links between argument components, with a secondary focus on classifying types of argument components. In order to solve this problem, we propose to use a modification of a Pointer Network architecture. A Pointer Network is appealing for this task for the following reasons: 1) It takes into account the sequential nature of argument components; 2) By construction, it enforces certain properties of the tree structure present in argument relations; 3) The hidden representations can be applied to auxiliary tasks. In order to extend the contribution of the original Pointer Network model, we construct a joint model that simultaneously attempts to learn the type of argument component, as well as continuing to predict links between argument components. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on two separate evaluation corpora. Furthermore, our results show that optimizing for both tasks, as well as adding a fully-connected layer prior to recurrent neural network input, is crucial for high performance.","ppotash@cs.uml.edu, aromanov@cs.uml.edu, arum@cs.uml.edu","Peter Potash, Alexey Romanov, Anna Rumshisky","cs.uml.edu, csail.mit.edu",Natural language processing,B1KBHtcel,potash|heres_my_point_argumentation_mining_with_pointer_networks,Here's My Point: Argumentation Mining with Pointer Networks,We use a modified Pointer Network to predict 1) types of argument components; 2) links between argument components.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel&noteId=B1KBHtcel,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1KBHtcel

We evaluate our model on a synthetic dataset, and a dataset with applications to automated theorem proving. By learning a latent representation over trees, our model can achieve similar test log likelihood to a standard autoregressive decoder, but with the number of sequentially dependent computations proportional to the depth of the tree instead of the number of nodes in the tree.","ricshin@cs.berkeley.edu, alemi@google.com, geoffreyi@google.com, vinyals@google.com","Richard Shin, Alexander A.

"Recent works on neural architectures have demonstrated the utility of attention mechanisms for a wide variety of tasks. Attention models used for problems such as image captioning typically depend on the image under consideration, as well as the previous sequence of words that come before the word currently being generated. While these types of models have produced impressive results, they are not able to model the higher-order interactions involved in problems such as video description/captioning, where the relationship between parts of the video and the concepts being depicted is complex. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel memory-based attention model for video description. Our model utilizes memories of past attention when reasoning about where to attend to in the current time step, similar to the central executive system proposed in human cognition. This allows the model to not only reason about local attention more effectively, it allows it to consider the entire sequence of video frames while generating each word. Evaluation on the challenging and popular MSVD and Charades datasets show that the proposed architecture outperforms all previously proposed methods and leads to a new state of the art results in the video description.","rasool.fakoor@mavs.uta.edu, asamir@microsoft.com, margarmitchell@gmail.com, SingBing.Kang@microsoft.com, pkohli@microsoft.com","Rasool Fakoor, Abdel-rahman Mohamed, Margaret Mitchell, Sing Bing Kang, Pushmeet Kohli","microsoft.com, uta.edu","Deep learning, Multi-modal learning, Computer vision",SkJeEtclx,fakoor|memoryaugmented_attention_modelling_for_videos,Memory-augmented Attention Modelling for Videos,We propose a novel memory-based attention model for video description,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx&noteId=SkJeEtclx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SkJeEtclx

been successfully used for specific applications, they remain largely ignored and
regarded as difficult to train. In this paper we formally characterize why these
networks can indeed often be difficult to train even in very simple scenarios, and
describe how the presence of infinitely many and shallow local minima emerges
from the architecture. We also provide an explanation to the good performance
achieved on a typical classification task, by showing that for several network architectures
the presence of the periodic cycles is largely ignored when the learning
is successful. Finally, we show that there are non-trivial tasks—such as learning
algorithms—where networks using sinusoidal activations can learn faster than

We propose a novel convolution framework approach on graphs which utilizes a random walk to select relevant nodes. The convolution shares weights on all features, providing the desired parameter efficiency.  Furthermore, the additional computations in the training process are only executed once in the pre-processing step.

"Due to deep cascades of nonlinear units, deep neural networks (DNNs) can automatically learn non-local generalization priors from data and have achieved high performance in various applications.
However, such properties have also opened a door for adversaries to generate the so-called adversarial examples to fool DNNs. Specifically, adversaries can inject small perturbations to the input data and therefore decrease the performance of deep neural networks significantly.
Even worse, these adversarial examples have the transferability to attack a black-box model based on finite queries without knowledge of the target model. 
Therefore, we aim to empirically compare different defensive strategies against various adversary models and analyze the cross-model efficiency for these robust learners. We conclude that the adversarial retraining framework also has the transferability, which can defend adversarial examples without requiring prior knowledge of the adversary models.
We compare the general adversarial retraining framework with the state-of-the-art robust deep neural networks, such as distillation, autoencoder stacked with classifier (AEC), and our improved version, IAEC, to evaluate their robustness as well as the vulnerability in terms of the distortion required to mislead the learner.
Our experimental results show that the adversarial retraining framework can defend most of the adversarial examples notably and consistently without adding additional
vulnerabilities or performance penalty to the original model.","jungyhuk@gmail.com, bbbli@umich.edu, yevgeniy.vorobeychik@vanderbilt.edu","Xinyun Chen, Bo Li, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik","umich.edu, vanderbilt.edu, sjtu.edu.cn",Deep learning,ByToKu9ll,chen|evaluation_of_defensive_methods_for_dnns_against_multiple_adversarial_evasion_models,Evaluation of Defensive Methods for DNNs against Multiple Adversarial Evasion Models,robust adversarial retraining,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByToKu9ll&noteId=ByToKu9ll,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ByToKu9ll
"Despite the long history of research on recommender systems, current approaches still face a number of challenges in practice, e.g. the difficulties in handling new items, the high diversity of user interests, and the noisiness and sparsity of observations. Many of such difficulties stem from the lack of expressive power to capture the complex relations between items and users. This paper presents a new method to tackle this problem, called Collaborative Deep Embedding. In this method, a pair of dual networks, one for encoding items and the other for users, are jointly trained in a collaborative fashion. 
Particularly, both networks produce embeddings at multiple aligned levels, which, when combined together, can accurately predict the matching between items and users. Compared to existing methods, the proposed one not only provides greater expressive power to capture complex matching relations, but also generalizes better to unseen items or users. On multiple real-world datasets, this method outperforms the state of the art.","xy014@ie.cuhk.edu.hk, dhlin@ie.cuhk.edu.hk, niu.haoying@huawei.com, cheng.jiefeng@huawei.com, li.zhenguo@huawei.com","Yilei Xiong, Dahua Lin, Haoying Niu, JIefeng Cheng, Zhenguo Li",cuhk.edu.hk,,r1w7Jdqxl,xiong|collaborative_deep_embedding_via_dual_networks,Collaborative Deep Embedding via Dual Networks,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl&noteId=r1w7Jdqxl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1w7Jdqxl
"In this work we propose a simple unsupervised approach for next frame prediction in video. Instead of directly predicting the pixels in a frame given past frames, we predict the transformations needed for generating the next frame in a sequence, given the transformations of the past frames. This leads to sharper results, while using a smaller prediction model.

In order to enable a fair comparison between different video frame prediction models, we also propose a new evaluation protocol. We use generated frames as input to a classifier trained with ground truth sequences. This criterion guarantees that models scoring high are those producing sequences which preserve discrim- inative features, as opposed to merely penalizing any deviation, plausible or not, from the ground truth.

"Neural networks provide a powerful framework for learning the association between input and response variables and making accurate predictions. However, in many applications such as healthcare, it is important to identify causal relationships between the inputs and the response variables to be able to change the response variables by intervention on the inputs. In pursuit of models whose predictive power comes maximally from causal variables, we propose a novel causal regularizer based on the independence of mechanisms assumption. We utilize the causal regularizer to steer deep neural network architectures towards causally-interpretable solutions. We perform a large-scale analysis of electronic health records. Employing expert's judgment as the causal ground-truth, we show that our causally-regularized algorithm outperforms its L1-regularized equivalence both in predictive performance as well as causal relevance. Finally, we show that the proposed causal regularizer can be used together with representation learning algorithms to yield up to 20% improvement in the causality score of the generated hypotheses.","bahadori@gatech.edu, kjchalup@caltech.edu, mp2893@gatech.edu, rchen87@gatech.edu, StewarWF@sutterhealth.org, jsun@cc.gatech.edu","Mohammad Taha Bahadori, Krzysztof Chalupka, Edward Choi, Robert Chen, Walter F.

"Recommender systems often use latent features to explain the behaviors of users and capture the properties of items. As users interact with different items over time, user and item features can influence each other, evolve and co-evolve over time. To accurately capture the fine grained nonlinear coevolution of these features, we propose a recurrent coevolutionary feature embedding process model, which combines recurrent neural network (RNN) with a multi-dimensional point process model. The RNN learns a nonlinear representation of user and item embeddings which take into account mutual influence between user and item features, and the feature evolution over time. We also develop an efficient stochastic gradient algorithm for learning parameters.

"Given an image,  humans  effortlessly run the image formation process backwards in their minds: they can tell albedo from shading,  foreground from background, and imagine the occluded parts of the scene behind foreground objects. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised inversion machine trained to generate similar imaginations that when rendered using differentiable, graphics-like decoders, produce the original visual input. We constrain the imagination spaces by providing exemplar memory repositories in the form of foreground segmented objects, albedo, shading, background scenes and imposing adversarial losses on the imagination spaces. Our model learns to perform such inversion with weak supervision, without ever having seen paired annotated data, that is, without having seen the image paired with the corresponding ground-truth imaginations. We demonstrate our method by applying it to three  Computer Vision tasks: image in-painting, intrinsic decomposition and object segmentation, each task having its own differentiable renderer.

We present a new approach, asynchronous layer-wise gradient descent that maximizes overlap of layer-wise backpropagation (computation) with gradient synchronization (communication). This approach provides maximal theoretical equivalence to the de facto gradient descent algorithm, requires limited asynchronicity across multiple iterations of gradient descent, theoretically improves overall speedup, while minimizing the additional space requirements for asynchronicity. We implement all of our proposed approaches using Caffe – a high performance Deep Learning library – and evaluate it on both an Intel Sandy Bridge cluster connected with InfiniBand as well as an NVIDIA DGX-1 connected with NVLink. The evaluations are performed on a set of well known workloads including AlexNet and GoogleNet on the ImageNet dataset.

"Filters in a convolutional network are typically parametrized in a pixel basis. As an orthonormal basis, pixels may represent any arbitrary vector in Rn. In this paper, we relax this orthonormality requirement and extend the set of viable bases to the generalized notion of frames. When applying suitable frame bases to ResNets on Cifar-10+ we demonstrate improved error rates by substitution only. By exploiting the transformation properties of such generalized bases, we arrive at steerable frames, that allow to continuously transform CNN filters under arbitrary Lie-groups. Further allowing us to locally separate pose from canonical appearance. We implement this in the Dynamic Steerable Frame Network, that dynamically estimates the transformations of filters, conditioned on its input. The derived method presents a hybrid of Dynamic Filter Networks and Spatial Transformer Networks that can be implemented in any convolutional architecture, as we illustrate in two examples. First, we illustrate estimation properties of steerable frames with a Dynamic Steerable Frame Network, compared to a Dynamic Filter Network on the task of edge detection, where we show clear advantages of the derived steerable frames. Lastly, we insert the Dynamic Steerable Frame Network as a module in a convolutional LSTM on the task of limited-data hand-gesture recognition from video and illustrate effective dynamic regularization and show clear advantages over Spatial Transformer Networks. In this paper, we have laid out the foundations of Frame-based convolutional networks and Dynamic Steerable Frame Networks while illustrating their advantages for continuously transforming features and data-efficient learning.","j.jacobsen@uva.nl, bert.debrabandere@esat.kuleuven.be, a.w.m.smeulders@uva.nl","Jörn-Henrik Jacobsen, Bert De Brabandere and Arnold W.M.

"Deep feedforward and recurrent networks have achieved impressive results in many perception and language processing applications.  Recently, more complex architectures such as Neural Turing Machines and Memory Networks have been proposed for tasks including question answering and general computation, creating a new set of optimization challenges. In this paper, we explore the low-overhead and easy-to-implement optimization technique of adding annealed Gaussian noise to the gradient, which we find surprisingly effective when training these very deep architectures.  Unlike classical weight noise, gradient noise injection is complementary to advanced stochastic optimization algorithms such as Adam and AdaGrad. The technique not only helps to avoid overfitting, but also can result in lower training loss. We see consistent improvements in performance across an array of complex models, including state-of-the-art deep networks for question answering and algorithm learning. We observe that this optimization strategy allows a fully-connected 20-layer deep network to escape a bad initialization with standard stochastic gradient descent. We encourage further application of this technique to additional modern neural architectures.","arvind@cs.umass.edu, luke@cs.umass.edu, qvl@google.com, lukaszkaiser@google.com, kkurach@google.com, ilyasu@openai.com, jmartens@cs.toronto.edu","Arvind Neelakantan, Luke Vilnis, Quoc V.

"Machine learning models of music typically break down the task of composition into a chronological process, composing a piece of music in a single pass from beginning to end. On the contrary, human composers write music in a nonlinear fashion, scribbling motifs here and there, often revisiting choices previously made. We explore the use of blocked Gibbs sampling as an analogue to the human approach, and introduce Coconet, a convolutional neural network in the NADE family of generative models. Despite ostensibly sampling from the same distribution as the NADE ancestral sampling procedure, we find that a blocked Gibbs approach significantly improves sample quality. We provide evidence that this is due to some conditional distributions being poorly modeled. Moreover, we show that even the cheap approximate blocked Gibbs procedure from Yao et al. (2014) yields better samples than ancestral sampling. We demonstrate the versatility of our method on unconditioned polyphonic music generation.","chengzhiannahuang@gmail.com, tim.cooijmans@umontreal.ca, adarob@google.com, aaron.courville@umontreal.ca, deck@google.com","Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang, Tim Cooijmans, Adam Roberts, Aaron Courville, Douglas Eck","umontreal.ca, google.com","Deep learning, Applications, Unsupervised Learning",r1Usiwcex,huang|counterpoint_by_convolution,Counterpoint by Convolution,"NADE generative model of music, with new insights on sampling",Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex&noteId=r1Usiwcex,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1Usiwcex
"Deep Residual Networks present a premium in performance in comparison to conventional
networks of the same depth and are trainable at extreme depths. It has
recently been shown that Residual Networks behave like ensembles of relatively
shallow networks. We show that these ensemble are dynamic: while initially
the virtual ensemble is mostly at depths lower than half the network’s depth, as
training progresses, it becomes deeper and deeper. The main mechanism that controls
the dynamic ensemble behavior is the scaling introduced, e.g., by the Batch
Normalization technique. We explain this behavior and demonstrate the driving
force behind it. As a main tool in our analysis, we employ generalized spin glass
models, which we also use in order to study the number of critical points in the

"There has been a lot of recent interest in trying to characterize the error surface of deep models. This stems from a long standing question. Given that deep networks are highly nonlinear systems optimized by local gradient methods, why do they not seem to be affected by bad local minima? It is widely believed that training of deep models using gradient methods works so well because the error surface either has no local minima, or if they exist they need to be close in value to the global minimum. It is known that such results hold under strong assumptions which are not satisfied by real models. In this paper we present examples showing that for such theorem to be true additional assumptions on the data, initialization schemes and/or the model classes have to be made. We look at the particular case of finite size datasets. We demonstrate that in this scenario one can construct counter-examples (datasets or initialization schemes) when the network does become susceptible to bad local minima over the weight space.","swirszcz@google.com, lejlot@google.com, razp@google.com","Grzegorz Swirszcz, Wojciech Marian Czarnecki, Razvan Pascanu",google.com,"Theory, Deep learning, Supervised Learning, Optimization",Syoiqwcxx,swirszcz|local_minima_in_training_of_deep_networks,Local minima in training of deep networks,"As a contribution to the discussion about error surface and the question why ""deep and cheap"" learning works so well we present concrete examples of local minima and obstacles arising in the training of deep models.",Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx&noteId=Syoiqwcxx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Syoiqwcxx
"The ability to generalize from past experience to solve previously unseen tasks is a key research challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we consider RL tasks defined as a sequence of high-level instructions described by natural language and study two types of generalization: to unseen and longer sequences of previously seen instructions, and to sequences where the instructions themselves were previously not seen. 
We present a novel hierarchical deep RL architecture that consists of two interacting neural controllers: a meta controller that reads instructions and repeatedly communicates subtasks to a subtask controller that in turn learns to perform such subtasks. To generalize better to unseen instructions, we propose a regularizer that encourages to learn subtask embeddings that capture correspondences between similar subtasks. We also propose a new differentiable neural network architecture in the meta controller that learns temporal abstractions which makes learning more stable under delayed reward. Our architecture is evaluated on a stochastic 2D grid world and a 3D visual environment where the agent should execute a list of instructions. We demonstrate that the proposed architecture is able to generalize well over unseen instructions as well as longer lists of instructions.","junhyuk@umich.edu, baveja@umich.edu, honglak@umich.edu, pkohli@microsoft.com","Junhyuk Oh, Satinder Singh, Honglak Lee, Pushmeet Kohli","umich.edu, microsoft.com","Reinforcement Learning, Deep learning",SJttqw5ge,oh|communicating_hierarchical_neural_controllers_for_learning_zeroshot_task_generalization,Communicating Hierarchical Neural Controllers for Learning Zero-shot Task Generalization,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge&noteId=SJttqw5ge,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJttqw5ge
"The preimage of the activity at a certain level of a deep network is the set of inputs that result in the same node activity. For fully connected multi layer rectifier networks we demonstrate how to compute the preimages of activities at arbitrary levels from knowledge of the parameters in a deep rectifying network. If the preimage set of a certain activity in the network contains elements from more than one class it means that these classes are irreversibly mixed. This implies that preimage sets which are piecewise linear manifolds are building blocks for describing the input manifolds specific classes, i.e. all preimages should ideally be from the same class. We believe that the knowledge of how to compute preimages will be valuable in understanding the efficiency displayed by deep learning networks and could potentially be used in designing more efficient training algorithms.","stefanc@kth.se, azizpour@kth.se, razavian@kth.se","Stefan Carlsson, Hossein Azizpour, Ali Razavian",kth.se,,HJcLcw9xg,carlsson|the_preimage_of_rectifier_network_activities,The Preimage of Rectifier Network Activities,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJcLcw9xg&noteId=HJcLcw9xg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJcLcw9xg
"Although attention-based Neural Machine Translation have achieved great success, attention-mechanism cannot capture the entire meaning of the source sentence because the attention mechanism generates a target word depending heavily on the relevant parts of the source sentence. The report of earlier studies has introduced a latent variable to capture the entire meaning of sentence and achieved improvement on attention-based Neural Machine Translation. We follow this approach and we believe that the capturing meaning of sentence benefits from image information because human beings understand the meaning of language not only from textual information but also from perceptual information such as that gained from vision. As described herein, we propose a neural machine translation model that introduces a continuous latent variable containing an underlying semantic extracted from texts and images.

"Sum-product networks (SPNs) are an expressive class of deep probabilistic models in which inference takes time linear in their size, enabling them to be learned effectively. However, for certain challenging problems, such as scene understanding, the corresponding SPN has exponential size and is thus intractable. In this work, we introduce submodular sum-product networks (SSPNs), an extension of SPNs in which sum-node weights are defined by a submodular energy function. SSPNs combine the expressivity and depth of SPNs with the ability to efficiently compute the MAP state of a combinatorial number of labelings afforded by submodular energies. SSPNs for scene understanding can be understood as representing all possible parses of an image over arbitrary region shapes with respect to an image grammar. Despite this complexity, we develop an efficient and convergent algorithm based on graph cuts for computing the (approximate) MAP state of an SSPN, greatly increasing the expressivity of the SPN model class. Empirically, we show exponential improvements in parsing time compared to traditional inference algorithms such as alpha-expansion and belief propagation, while returning comparable minima.","afriesen@cs.washington.edu, pedrod@cs.washington.edu","Abram L.

"Computer vision has made remarkable progress in recent years. Deep neural network (DNN) models optimized to identify objects in images exhibit unprecedented task-trained accuracy and, remarkably, some generalization ability: new visual problems can now be solved more easily based on previous learning. Biological vision (learned in life and through evolution) is also accurate and general-purpose. Is it possible that these different learning regimes converge to similar problem-dependent optimal computations? We therefore asked whether the human system-level computation of visual perception has DNN correlates and considered several anecdotal test cases. We found that perceptual sensitivity to image changes has DNN mid-computation correlates, while sensitivity to segmentation, crowding and shape has DNN end-computation correlates. Our results quantify the applicability of using DNN computation to estimate perceptual loss, and are consistent with the fascinating theoretical view that properties of human perception are a consequence of architecture-independent visual learning.",ron.dekel@weizmann.ac.il,Ron Dekel,weizmann.ac.il,"Computer vision, Transfer Learning",BJbD_Pqlg,dekel|human_perception_in_computer_vision,Human perception in computer vision,Correlates for several properties of human perception emerge in convolutional neural networks following image categorization learning.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJbD_Pqlg&noteId=BJbD_Pqlg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJbD_Pqlg
"Encoder-decoder models have been widely used to solve sequence to sequence prediction tasks. However current approaches suffer from two shortcomings. First, the encoders compute a representation of each word taking into account only the history of the words it has read so far, yielding suboptimal representations. Second, current models utilize large vocabularies in order to minimize the problem of unknown words, resulting in slow decoding times and large storage costs. In this paper we address both shortcomings. Towards this goal, we first introduce a simple mechanism that first reads the input sequence before committing to a representation of each word. Furthermore, we propose a simple copy mechanism that is able to exploit very small vocabularies and handle out-of-vocabulary words.

The second network is a generator network, which is a non-linear version of factor analysis. It is defined by a  top-down ConvNet, which maps the latent factors to the observed signal. The maximum likelihood training algorithms of both the descriptor net and the generator net are in the form of alternating back-propagation, and both algorithms involve Langevin sampling.

Second, our approach can be applied to assess the invariance of the learned features captured at any layer with respect to the class of the particular input.

However, translation is just one of a myriad of useful spatial transformations. Can the same efficiency be attained when considering other spatial invariances? Such generalized convolutions have been considered in the past, but at a high computational cost. We present a construction that is simple and exact, yet has the same computational complexity that standard convolutions enjoy. It consists of a constant image warp followed by a simple convolution, which are standard blocks in deep learning toolboxes. With a carefully crafted warp, the resulting architecture can be made equivariant to a wide range of 2-parameters spatial transformations.

"We show how to adjust for the variance introduced by dropout with corrections to weight initialization and Batch Normalization, yielding higher accuracy. Though dropout can preserve the expected input to a neuron between train and test, the variance of the input differs. We thus propose a new weight initialization by correcting for the influence of dropout rates and an arbitrary nonlinearity's influence on variance through simple corrective scalars. Since Batch Normalization trained with dropout estimates the variance of a layer's incoming distribution with some inputs dropped, the variance also differs between train and test. After training a network with Batch Normalization and dropout, we simply update Batch Normalization's variance moving averages with dropout off and obtain state of the art on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 without data augmentation.","dan@ttic.edu, kgimpel@ttic.edu","Dan Hendrycks, Kevin Gimpel","uchicago.edu, ttic.edu",,r1BJLw9ex,hendrycks|adjusting_for_dropout_variance_in_batch_normalization_and_weight_initialization,Adjusting for Dropout Variance in Batch Normalization and Weight Initialization,Batch Norm Incorrectly Estimates Variance When Dropout Is On,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex&noteId=r1BJLw9ex,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1BJLw9ex

"Deep convolutional networks are well-known for their high computational and memory demands. Given limited resources, how does one design a network that balances its size, training time, and prediction accuracy? A surprisingly effective approach to trade accuracy for size and speed is to simply reduce the number of channels in each convolutional layer by a fixed fraction and retrain the network. In many cases this leads to significantly smaller networks with only minimal changes to accuracy. In this paper, we take a step further by empirically examining a strategy for deactivating connections between filters in convolutional layers in a way that allows us to harvest savings both in run-time and memory for many network architectures. More specifically, we generalize 2D convolution to use a channel-wise sparse connection structure and show that this leads to significantly better results than the baseline approach for large networks including VGG and Inception V3.","schangpi@usc.edu, sandler@google.com, azhmogin@google.com","Soravit Changpinyo, Mark Sandler, Andrey Zhmoginov","usc.edu, google.com","Deep learning, Supervised Learning",SkC_7v5gx,changpinyo|the_power_of_sparsity_in_convolutional_neural_networks,The Power of Sparsity in Convolutional Neural Networks,Sparse random connections that allow savings to be harvested and that are very effective at compressing CNNs.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkC_7v5gx&noteId=SkC_7v5gx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SkC_7v5gx

"Word embeddings, which represent a word as a point in a vector space, have become ubiquitous to several NLP tasks. A recent line of work uses bilingual (two languages) corpora to learn a different vector for each sense of a word, by exploiting crosslingual signals to aid sense identification.

Ours is the first approach with the ability to leverage multilingual corpora efficiently for multi-sense representation learning. Experiments show that multilingual training significantly improves performance over monolingual and bilingual training, by allowing us to combine different parallel corpora to leverage multilingual context.

Typical variational inference methods, however, require to use inference networks with computationally tractable probability density functions. This largely limits the design and implementation of variational inference methods. We consider wild variational inference methods that do not require tractable density functions on the inference networks, and hence can be applied in more challenging cases. As an example of application, we treat stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as an inference network, and use our methods to automatically adjust the step sizes of SGLD to maximize its convergence speed, significantly outperforming the hand-designed step size schemes.","qiang.liu@dartmouth.edu, yihao.feng.gr@dartmouth.edu","Qiang Liu, Yihao Feng",cs.dartmouth.edu,Theory,Sy4tzwqxe,liu|two_methods_for_wild_variational_inference,Two Methods for Wild Variational Inference,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy4tzwqxe&noteId=Sy4tzwqxe,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy4tzwqxe
"With ever-increasing computational demand for deep learning, it is critical to investigate the implications of the numeric representation and precision of DNN model weights and activations on computational efficiency. In this work, we explore unconventional narrow-precision floating-point representations as it relates to inference accuracy and efficiency to steer the improved design of future DNN platforms.  We show that inference using these custom numeric representations on production-grade DNNs, including GoogLeNet and VGG, achieves an average speedup of 7.6x with less than 1% degradation in inference accuracy relative to a state-of-the-art baseline platform representing the most sophisticated hardware using single-precision floating point.

"In this paper, we focus on online representation learning in non-stationary environments which may require continuous adaptation of model’s architecture. We propose a novel online dictionary-learning (sparse-coding) framework which incorporates the addition and deletion of hidden units (dictionary elements), and is inspired by the adult neurogenesis phenomenon in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, known to be associated with improved cognitive function and adaptation to new environments. In the online learning setting, where new input instances arrive sequentially in batches, the “neuronal birth” is implemented by adding new units with random initial weights (random dictionary elements); the number of new units is determined by the current performance (representation error) of the dictionary, higher error causing an increase in the birth rate. “Neuronal death” is implemented by imposing l1/l2-regularization (group sparsity) on the dictionary within the block-coordinate descent optimization at each iteration of our online alternating minimization scheme, which iterates between the code and dictionary updates. Finally, hidden unit connectivity adaptation is facilitated by introducing sparsity in dictionary elements. Our empirical evaluation on several real-life datasets (images and language) as well as on synthetic data demonstrates that the proposed approach can considerably outperform the state-of-art fixed-size (nonadaptive) online sparse coding of Mairal et al. (2009) in the presence of nonstationary data. Moreover, we identify certain properties of the data (e.g., sparse inputs with nearly non-overlapping supports) and of the model (e.g., dictionary sparsity) associated with such improvements.","sahilgar@usc.edu, rish@us.ibm.com, gcecchi@us.ibm.com, aclozano@us.ibm.com","Sahil Garg, Irina Rish, Guillermo Cecchi, Aurelie Lozano","usc.edu, us.ibm.com, isi.edu","Unsupervised Learning, Computer vision, Transfer Learning, Optimization, Applications",HyecJGP5ge,garg|neurogenesisinspired_dictionary_learning_online_model_adaption_in_a_changing_world,NEUROGENESIS-INSPIRED DICTIONARY LEARNING: ONLINE MODEL ADAPTION IN A CHANGING WORLD,"An online dictionary learning incorporates dynamic model adaptation, adding/deleting its elements in response to nonstationary data.",Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge&noteId=HyecJGP5ge,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HyecJGP5ge
"Neural sequence models are widely used to model time-series data. Equally ubiquitous is the usage of beam search (BS) as an approximate inference algorithm to decode output sequences from these models. BS explores the search space in a greedy left-right fashion retaining only the top B candidates. This tends to result in sequences that differ only slightly from each other. Producing lists of nearly identical sequences is not only computationally wasteful but also typically fails to capture the inherent ambiguity of complex AI tasks. To overcome this problem, we propose Diverse Beam Search (DBS), an alternative to BS that decodes a list of diverse outputs by optimizing a diversity-augmented objective. We observe that our method not only improved diversity but also finds better top 1 solutions by controlling for the exploration and exploitation of the search space. Moreover, these gains are achieved with minimal computational or memory overhead com- pared to beam search. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we present results on image captioning, machine translation, conversation and visual question generation using both standard quantitative metrics and qualitative human studies. We find that our method consistently outperforms BS and previously proposed techniques for diverse decoding from neural sequence models.","ashwinkv@vt.edu, cogswell@vt.edu, ram21@vt.edu, sunqing@vt.edu, steflee@vt.edu, djcran@indiana.edu, dbatra@vt.edu","Ashwin K Vijayakumar, Michael Cogswell, Ramprasaath R.

While methods for nonlinear two-view representation learning (Deep CCA, (Andrew et al., 2013)) and linear many-view representation learning (Generalized CCA (Horst, 1961)) exist, DGCCA is the first CCA-style multiview representation learning technique that combines the flexibility of nonlinear (deep) representation learning with the statistical power of incorporating information from many independent sources, or views. We present the DGCCA formulation as well as an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm for solving it. We learn DGCCA representations on two distinct datasets for three downstream tasks: phonetic transcription from acoustic and articulatory measurements, and recommending hashtags and friends on a dataset of Twitter users. We find that DGCCA representations soundly beat existing methods at phonetic transcription and hashtag recommendation, and in general perform no worse than standard linear many-view techniques.","adrian@cs.jhu.edu, huda@jhu.edu, bgujral1@jhu.edu, reisinger@cogsci.jhu.edu, zsheng2@jhu.edu, arora@cs.jhu.edu","Adrian Benton, Huda Khayrallah, Biman Gujral, Drew Reisinger, Sheng Zhang, Raman Arora","cs.jhu.edu, berkeley.edu","Unsupervised Learning, Deep learning, Multi-modal learning",HycUbvcge,benton|deep_generalized_canonical_correlation_analysis,Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis,A multiview representation learning technique that can learn nonlinear mappings from arbitrarily many views to a shared semantic space -- Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge&noteId=HycUbvcge,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HycUbvcge
"We develop a new model for Interactive Question Answering (IQA), using Gated-Recurrent-Unit recurrent networks (GRUs) as encoders for statements and questions, and another GRU as a decoder for outputs. Distinct from previous work, our approach employs context-dependent word-level attention for more accurate statement representations and question-guided sentence-level attention for better context modeling. Employing these mechanisms, our model accurately understands when it can output an answer or when it requires generating a supplementary question for additional input. When available, user's feedback is encoded and directly applied to update sentence-level attention to infer the answer.

"Inverse problems are typically solved by first defining a model and then choosing an inference procedure. With this separation of modeling from inference, inverse problems can be framed in a modular way. For example, variational inference can be applied to a broad class of models. The modularity, however, typically goes away after model parameters have been trained under a chosen inference procedure. During training, model and inference often interact in a way that the model parameters will ultimately be adapted to the chosen inference procedure, posing the two components inseparable after training. But if model and inference become inseperable after training, why separate them in the first place?

We propose a novel learning framework which abandons the dichotomy between model and inference. Instead, we introduce Recurrent Inference Machines (RIM), a class of recurrent neural networks (RNN) that directly learn to solve inverse problems.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs in experiments on various image reconstruction tasks. We show empirically that RIMs exhibit the desirable convergence behavior of classical inference procedures, and that they can outperform state-of- the-art methods when trained on specialized inference tasks.

Our approach bridges the gap between inverse problems and deep learning, providing a framework for fast progression in the field of inverse problems.","patrick.putzky@gmail.com, welling.max@gmail.com","Patrick Putzky, Max Welling","uva.nl, ceasar.de, uci.edu","Optimization, Deep learning, Computer vision",HkSOlP9lg,putzky|recurrent_inference_machines_for_solving_inverse_problems,Recurrent Inference Machines for Solving Inverse Problems,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg&noteId=HkSOlP9lg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HkSOlP9lg

Each forward pass of the predictron accumulates internal rewards and values over multiple planning depths. 
The predictron is trained end-to-end so as to make these accumulated values accurately approximate the true value function, thereby focusing the model upon the aspects of the environment most relevant to planning.

"The storage and computation requirements of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be prohibitive for exploiting these models over low-power or embedded devices. This paper reduces the computational complexity of the CNNs by minimizing an objective function, including the recognition loss that is augmented with a sparsity-promoting penalty term. The sparsity structure of the network is identified using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which is widely used in large optimization problems. This method alternates between promoting the sparsity of the network and optimizing the recognition performance, which allows us to exploit the two-part structure of the corresponding objective functions. In particular, we take advantage of the separability of the sparsity-inducing penalty functions to decompose the minimization problem into sub-problems that can be solved sequentially. Applying our method to a variety of state-of-the-art CNN models, our proposed method is able to simplify the original model, generating models with less computation and fewer parameters, while maintaining and often improving generalization performance. Accomplishments on a variety of models strongly verify that our proposed ADMM-based method can be a very useful tool for simplifying and improving deep CNNs.","farkhondeh.kiaee.1@ulaval.ca, christian.gagne@gel.ulaval.ca, mahdieh.abbasi.1@ulaval.ca","Farkhondeh Kiaee, Christian Gagné, and Mahdieh Abbasi","ulaval.ca, inria.fr, sharif.ir, aut.ac.ir","Deep learning, Computer vision, Optimization",rye9LT8cee,kiaee|alternating_direction_method_of_multipliers_for_sparse_convolutional_neural_networks,Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Sparse Convolutional Neural Networks,A method to sparsify (prune) pre-trained deep neural networks.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee&noteId=rye9LT8cee,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rye9LT8cee
"Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants are the most important optimization algorithms used in large scale machine learning. Mini-batch version of stochastic gradient is often used in practice for taking advantage of hardware parallelism. In this work, we analyze the effect of mini-batch size over SGD convergence for the case of general non-convex objective functions. Building on the past analyses, we justify mathematically that there can often be a large difference between the convergence guarantees provided by small and large mini-batches (given each instance processes equal number of training samples), while providing experimental evidence for the same. Going further to distributed settings, we show that an analogous effect holds with popular Asynchronous Gradient Descent (\asgd): there can be a large difference between convergence guarantees with increasing number of learners given that the cumulative number of training samples processed remains the same. Thus there is an inherent (and similar) inefficiency introduced in the convergence behavior when we attempt to take advantage of parallelism, either by increasing mini-batch size or by increase the number of learners.","onkar.bhardwaj@gmail.com, gcong@us.ibm.com","Onkar Bhardwaj, Guojing Cong",ibm.com,"Deep learning, Optimization",Bk_zTU5eg,bhardwaj|inefficiency_of_stochastic_gradient_descent_with_larger_minibatches_and_more_learners,Inefficiency of stochastic gradient descent with larger mini-batches (and more learners),We theoretically justify that increasing mini-batch size or increasing the number of learners can lead to slower SGD/ASGD convergence,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk_zTU5eg&noteId=Bk_zTU5eg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Bk_zTU5eg
"A recognized obstacle to training undirected graphical models with latent variables such as Boltzmann machines is that the maximum likelihood training procedure requires sampling from Monte-Carlo Markov chains which may not mix well, in the inner loop of training, for each example.  We first propose the idea that it is sufficient to locally carve the energy function everywhere so that its gradient points in the ""right"" direction (i.e., towards generating the data). Following on previous work on contrastive divergence, denoising autoencoders, generative stochastic networks and unsupervised learning using non-equilibrium dynamics, we propose a variational bound on the marginal log-likelihood of the data which corresponds to a new learning procedure that first walks away from data points by following the model transition operator and then trains that operator to walk backwards for each of these steps, back towards the training example. The tightness of the variational bound relies on gradually increasing temperature as we walk away from the data, at each step providing a gradient on the parameters to maximize the probability that the transition operator returns to its previous state. Interestingly, this algorithm admits a variant where there is no explicit energy function, i.e., the parameters are used to directly define the transition operator. This also eliminates the explicit need for symmetric weights which previous Boltzmann machine or Hopfield net models require, and which makes these models less biologically plausible.","anirudhgoyal9119@gmail.com, rosemary.nan.ke@gmail.com, lambalex@iro.umontreal.ca, yoshua.umontreal@gmail.com","Anirudh Goyal, Nan Rosemary Ke, Alex Lamb, Yoshua Bengio","umontreal.ca, amazon.com",Unsupervised Learning,rkpdnIqlx,goyal|the_variational_walkback_algorithm,The Variational Walkback Algorithm,A new algorithm for training undirected graphical models.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx&noteId=rkpdnIqlx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkpdnIqlx
"Transfer learning is a popular practice in deep neural networks, but fine-tuning of a large number of parameters is a hard challenge due to the complex wiring of neurons between splitting layers and imbalance class distributions of original and transferred domains. Recent advances in evidence theory show that in an imbalance multiclass learning problem, optimizing of proper objective functions based on contingency tables prevents biases towards high-prior classes. Transfer learning usually deals with highly non-convex objectives and local minima in deep neural architectures. We propose a novel distributed transfer learning to tackle both optimization complexity and class-imbalance problem jointly. Our solution imposes separated greedy regularization to each individual convolutional filter to make single-filter neural networks such that the minority classes perform as the majority ones. Then, basic probability assignment from evidence theory boosts these distributed networks to improve the recognition performance on the target domains.

"This paper shows how, by combining prior and supervised representations, one can create architectures that lead to nearly state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks, which mean they perform as well as a deep network learned from scratch. We use scattering as a generic and fixed initialization of the first layers of a deep network, and learn the remaining layers in a supervised manner. We numerically demonstrate that deep hybrid scattering networks generalize better on small datasets than supervised deep networks. Scattering networks could help current systems to save computation time, while guaranteeing the stability  to geometric transformations and noise of the first internal layers. We also show that the learned operators explicitly build invariances to geometrical variabilities, such as local rotation and translation, by analyzing the third layer of our architecture.  We demonstrate that it is possible to replace the scattering transform by a standard deep network at the cost of having to learn more parameters and potentially adding instabilities.

Moreover, when converted into Max-Product Networks (MPNs), it is possible to decode such representations back into the original input space. In this way, MPNs can be interpreted as a kind of generative autoencoder, even if they were never trained to reconstruct the input data. We show how these learned representations, if visualized, indeed correspond to ""meaningful parts"" of the training data. They also yield a large improvement when used in structured prediction tasks.

Such architectures with the proposed objective can be trained efficiently using stochastic gradient descent and scaled to large graphs.

"In this paper, we extend neural Turing machine (NTM) into a dynamic neural Turing machine (D-NTM) by introducing a trainable memory addressing scheme. This addressing scheme maintains for each memory cell two separate vectors, content and address vectors. This allows the D-NTM to learn a wide variety of location-based addressing strategies including both linear and nonlinear ones. We implement the D-NTM with both continuous, differentiable and discrete, non-differentiable read/write mechanisms. We investigate the mechanisms and effects for learning to read and  write to a memory through experiments on Facebook bAbI tasks using both a feedforward and GRU-controller. The D-NTM is evaluated on a set of Facebook bAbI tasks and shown to outperform NTM and LSTM baselines.

"Classifying products into categories precisely and efficiently is a major challenge in modern e-commerce. The high traffic of new products uploaded daily and the dynamic nature of the categories raise the need for machine learning models that can reduce the cost and time of human editors. In this paper, we propose a decision level fusion approach for multi-modal product classification using text and image inputs. We train input specific state-of-the-art deep neural networks for each input source, show the potential of forging them together into a multi-modal architecture and train a novel policy network that learns to choose between them. Finally, we demonstrate that our multi-modal network improves the top-1 accuracy $\%$ over both networks on a real-world large-scale product classification dataset that we collected from Walmart.com.

"Steganography is collection of methods to hide secret information (""payload"") within non-secret information (""container""). Its counterpart, Steganalysis, is the practice of determining if a message contains a hidden payload, and recovering it if possible.

In the present study, we propose a new model for generating image-like containers based on Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). This approach allows to generate more setganalysis-secure message embedding using standard steganography algorithms.

"Training a classifier with only a few examples remains a significant barrier when using neural networks with large number of parameters. Though various specialized network architectures have been proposed for these k-shot learning tasks to avoid overfitting, a question remains: is there a generalizable framework for the k-shot learning problem that can leverage existing deep models as well as avoid model overfitting? In this paper, we proposed a generalizable k-shot learning framework that can be used on any pre-trained network, by grouping network parameters to produce a low-dimensional representation of the parameter space. The grouping of the parameters is based on an orthogonal decomposition of the parameter space. To avoid overfitting, groups of parameters will be updated together during the k-shot training process. Furthermore, this framework can be integrated with any existing popular deep neural networks such as VGG, GoogleNet, ResNet, without any changes in the original network structure or any sacrifices in performance. We evaluate our framework on a wide range of intra/inter-dataset k-shot learning tasks and show state-of-the-art performance.","haoqif@andrew.cmu.edu, kkitani@cs.cmu.edu","Haoqi Fan, Yu Zhang, Kris M.

"Deep learning methods exhibit promising performance for predictive modeling in healthcare, but two important challenges remain:
- Data insufficiency: Often in healthcare predictive modeling, the sample size is insufficient for deep learning methods to achieve satisfactory results. 
- Interpretation: The representations learned by deep learning models should align with medical knowledge.
To address these challenges, we propose a GRaph-based Attention Model, GRAM that supplements electronic health records (EHR) with hierarchical information inherent to medical ontologies. 
Based on the data volume and the ontology structure, GRAM represents a medical concept as a combination of its ancestors in the ontology via an attention mechanism. 
We compared predictive performance (i.e. accuracy, data needs, interpretability) of GRAM to various methods including the recurrent neural network (RNN) in two sequential diagnoses prediction tasks and one heart failure prediction task.
Compared to the basic RNN, GRAM achieved 10% higher accuracy for predicting diseases rarely observed in the training data and 3% improved area under the ROC curve for predicting heart failure using an order of magnitude less training data. Additionally, unlike other methods, the medical concept representations learned by GRAM are well aligned with the medical ontology. Finally, GRAM exhibits intuitive attention behaviors by adaptively generalizing to higher level concepts when facing data insufficiency at the lower level concepts.","mp2893@gatech.edu, bahadori@gatech.edu, lsong@cc.gatech.edu, stewarwf@sutterhealth.org, jsun@cc.gatech.edu","Edward Choi, Mohammad Taha Bahadori, Le Song, Walter F.

"In this work, we present a compact, modular framework for constructing new recurrent neural architectures. Our basic module is a new generic unit, the Transition Based Recurrent Unit (TBRU). In addition to hidden layer activations, TBRUs have discrete state dynamics that allow network connections to be built dynamically as a function of intermediate activations. By connecting multiple TBRUs, we can extend and combine commonly used architectures such as sequence-to-sequence, attention mechanisms, and recursive tree-structured models. A TBRU can also serve as both an {\em encoder} for downstream tasks and as a {\em decoder} for its own task simultaneously, resulting in more accurate multi-task learning. We call our approach Dynamic Recurrent Acyclic Graphical Neural Networks, or DRAGNN.

"We investigate deep generative models that can exchange multiple modalities bi-directionally, e.g., generating images from corresponding texts and vice versa. Recently, some studies handle multiple modalities on deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, these models typically assume that modalities are forced to have a conditioned relation, i.e., we can only generate modalities in one direction. To achieve our objective, we should extract a joint representation that captures high-level concepts among all modalities and through which we can exchange them bi-directionally. As described herein, we propose a joint multimodal variational autoencoder (JMVAE), in which all modalities are independently conditioned on joint representation. In other words, it models a joint distribution of modalities. Furthermore, to be able to generate missing modalities from the remaining modalities properly, we develop an additional method, JMVAE-kl, that is trained by reducing the divergence between JMVAE's encoder and prepared networks of respective modalities. Our experiments show that our proposed method can obtain appropriate joint representation from multiple modalities and that it can generate and reconstruct them more properly than conventional VAEs. We further demonstrate that JMVAE can generate multiple modalities bi-directionally.","masa@weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp, k-nakayama@weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp, matsuo@weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp","Masahiro Suzuki, Kotaro Nakayama, Yutaka Matsuo",u-tokyo.ac.jp,,Hk8rlUqge,suzuki|joint_multimodal_learning_with_deep_generative_models,Joint Multimodal Learning with Deep Generative Models,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge&noteId=Hk8rlUqge,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Hk8rlUqge
"Memory networks are neural networks with an explicit memory component that can be both read and written to by the network. The memory is often addressed in a soft way using a softmax function, making end-to-end training with backpropagation possible. However, this is not computationally scalable for applications which require the network to read from extremely large memories. On the other hand, it is well known that hard attention mechanisms based on reinforcement learning are challenging to train successfully. In this paper, we explore a form of hierarchical memory network, which can be considered as a hybrid between hard and soft attention memory networks. The memory is organized in a hierarchical structure such that reading from it is done with less computation than soft attention over a flat memory, while also being easier to train than hard attention over a flat memory. Specifically, we propose to incorporate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the training and inference procedures for our hierarchical memory network. We explore the use of various state-of-the art approximate MIPS techniques and report results on SimpleQuestions, a challenging large scale factoid question answering task.","apsarathchandar@gmail.com, sjn.ahn@gmail.com, hugo@twitter.com, vincentp@iro.umontreal.ca, gtesauro@us.ibm.com, yoshua.bengio@umontreal.ca","Sarath Chandar, Sungjin Ahn, Hugo Larochelle, Pascal Vincent, Gerald Tesauro, Yoshua Bengio","umontreal.ca, twitter.com, iitm.ac.in, usherbrooke.ca, google.com","Deep learning, Natural language processing",BJ0Ee8cxx,chandar|hierarchical_memory_networks,Hierarchical Memory Networks,We propose a hierarchical memory organization strategy for efficient memory access in memory networks with large memory.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx&noteId=BJ0Ee8cxx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJ0Ee8cxx

To understand this approximate invertibility phenomenon and how to leverage it more effectively, we focus on a theoretical explanation and develop a mathematical model of sparse signal recovery that is consistent with CNNs with random weights. We give an exact connection to a particular model of model-based compressive sensing (and its recovery algorithms) and random-weight CNNs. We show empirically that several learned networks are consistent with our mathematical analysis and then demonstrate that with such a simple theoretical framework, we can obtain reasonable reconstruction results on real images.

"Deep learning research over the past years has shown that by increasing the scope or difficulty of the learning problem over time, increasingly complex learning problems can be addressed. We study incremental learning in the context of sequence learning, using generative RNNs in the form of multi-layer recurrent Mixture Density Networks. While the potential of incremental or curriculum learning to enhance learning is known, indiscriminate application of the principle does not necessarily lead to improvement, and it is essential therefore to know which forms of incremental or curriculum learning have a positive effect. This research contributes to that aim by comparing three instantiations of incremental or curriculum learning.

We introduce Incremental Sequence Learning, a simple incremental approach to sequence learning. Incremental Sequence Learning starts out by using only the first few steps of each sequence as training data. Each time a performance criterion has been reached, the length of the parts of the sequences used for training is increased.

We introduce and make available a novel sequence learning task and data set: predicting and classifying MNIST pen stroke sequences. We find that Incremental Sequence Learning greatly speeds up sequence learning and reaches the best test performance level of regular sequence learning 20 times faster, reduces the test error by 74%, and in general performs more robustly; it displays lower variance and achieves sustained progress after all three comparison methods have stopped improving. The other instantiations of curriculum learning do not result in any noticeable improvement. A trained sequence prediction model is also used in transfer learning to the task of sequence classification, where it is found that transfer learning realizes improved classification performance compared to methods that learn to classify from scratch.",edwin.webmail@gmail.com,Edwin D. de Jong,n/a,"Deep learning, Supervised Learning",rJg_1L5gg,jong|incremental_sequence_learning,Incremental Sequence Learning,"We investigate a technique for sequence learning where the initial parts of the sequences are learned first; this is found to not only greatly speed up learning, but moreover to strongly improve generalization performance.",Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg&noteId=rJg_1L5gg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJg_1L5gg

"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have advanced the state-of-the-art on a variety of machine learning tasks and are deployed widely in many real-world products. However, the compute and data requirements demanded by large-scale DNNs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address this challenge in the context of DNN inference. We propose Dynamic Variable Effort Deep Neural Networks (DyVEDeep), which exploit the heterogeneity in the characteristics of inputs to DNNs to improve their compute efficiency while maintaining the same classification accuracy. DyVEDeep equips DNNs with dynamic effort knobs, which in course of processing an input, identify how critical a group of computations are to classify the input. DyVEDeep dynamically focuses its compute effort only on the critical computations, while the skipping/approximating the rest. We propose 3 effort knobs that operate at different levels of granularity viz. neuron, feature and layer levels. We build DyVEDeep versions for 5 popular image recognition benchmarks on 3 image datasets---MNIST, CIFAR and ImageNet. Across all benchmarks, DyVEDeep achieves 2.1X-2.6X reduction in number of scalar operations, which translates to 1.9X-2.3X performance improvement over a Caffe-based sequential software implementation, for negligible loss in accuracy.","sanjaygana@gmail.com, venkata0@purdue.edu, ravi@cse.iitm.ac.in, raghunathan@purdue.edu","Sanjay Ganapathy, Swagath Venkataramani, Balaraman Ravindran, Anand Raghunathan","purdue.edu, iitm.ac.in",,BJmCKBqgl,ganapathy|dyvedeep_dynamic_variable_effort_deep_neural_networks,DyVEDeep: Dynamic Variable Effort Deep Neural Networks,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJmCKBqgl&noteId=BJmCKBqgl,https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ynhm1wy5vu2swq/DyVEDeep-ICLR2017.pdf
"Neural machine translation aims at building a single large neural network that can be trained to maximize translation performance. The encoder-decoder architecture with an attention mechanism achieves a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based systems. However, the use of large vocabulary becomes the bottleneck in both training and improving the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture which learns morphology by using two recurrent networks and a hierarchical decoder which translates at character level. This gives rise to a deep character-level model consisting of six recurrent networks. Such a deep model has two major advantages. It avoids the large vocabulary issue radically; at the same time, it is more efficient in training than word-based models. Our model obtains a higher BLEU score than the bpe-based model after training for one epoch on En-Fr and En-Cs translation tasks.

"In this paper we propose a scalable version of a state-of-the-art deterministic time-
invariant feature extraction approach based on consecutive changes of basis and
nonlinearities, namely, the scattering network. The first focus of the paper is to
extend the scattering network to allow the use of higher order nonlinearities as
well as extracting nonlinear and Fourier based statistics leading to the required in-
variants of any inherently structured input. In order to reach fast convolutions and
to leverage the intrinsic structure of wavelets, we derive our complete model in the
Fourier domain. In addition of providing fast computations, we are now able to
exploit sparse matrices due to extremely high sparsity well localized in the Fourier
domain. As a result, we are able to reach a true linear time complexity with in-
puts in the Fourier domain allowing fast and energy efficient solutions to machine

"Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a bipartite graphical model that is used as the building block in energy-based deep generative models. Due to numerical stability and quantifiability of the likelihood,  RBM is commonly used with Bernoulli units. Here, we consider an alternative member of exponential family RBM with leaky rectified linear units -- called leaky RBM.  We first study the joint and marginal distributions of leaky RBM under different leakiness, which provides us important insights by connecting the leaky RBM model and truncated Gaussian distributions.  The connection leads us to a simple yet efficient method for sampling from this model, where the basic idea is to anneal the leakiness rather than the energy; -- i.e., start from a fully Gaussian/Linear unit and gradually decrease the leakiness over iterations.  This serves as an alternative to the annealing of the temperature parameter and enables numerical estimation of the likelihood that are more efficient and more accurate than the commonly used annealed importance sampling (AIS).  We further demonstrate that the proposed sampling algorithm enjoys faster mixing property than contrastive divergence algorithm, which benefits the training without any additional computational cost.","chunlial@cs.cmu.edu, mravanba@cs.cmu.edu, bapoczos@cs.cmu.edu","Chun-Liang Li, Siamak Ravanbakhsh, Barnabas Poczos",cs.cmu.edu,"Deep learning, Unsupervised Learning",H1GEvHcee,li|annealing_gaussian_into_relu_a_new_sampling_strategy_for_leakyrelu_rbm,Annealing Gaussian into ReLU: a New Sampling Strategy for Leaky-ReLU RBM,We study fundamental property of leaky RBM.

"As the complexity of deep neural networks (DNNs) trends to grow to absorb the increasing sizes of data, memory and energy consumption has been receiving more and more attentions for industrial applications, especially on mobile devices. This paper presents a novel structure based on homologically functional hashing to compress DNNs, shortly named as HFH. For each  weight entry in a deep net, HFH uses multiple low-cost hash functions to fetch values in a compression space, and then employs a small reconstruction network to recover that entry. The compression space is homological because all layers fetch hashed values from it. The reconstruction network is plugged into the whole network and trained jointly. On several benchmark datasets, HFH demonstrates high compression ratios with little loss on prediction accuracy. Particularly, HFH includes the recently proposed HashedNets as a degenerated scenario and shows significantly improved performance. Moreover, the homological hashing essence facilitates us to efficiently figure out one single desired compression ratio, instead of exhaustive searching throughout a combinatory space configured by all layers.","shilei06@baidu.com, fengshikun01@baidu.com, zhuzhifan@baidu.com","Lei Shi, Shikun Feng, Zhifan Zhu",baidu.com,,Hyanrrqlg,shi|hfh_homologically_functional_hashing_for_compressing_deep_neural_networks,HFH: Homologically Functional Hashing for Compressing Deep Neural Networks,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyanrrqlg&noteId=Hyanrrqlg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Hyanrrqlg
"How much can pruning algorithms teach us about the fundamentals of learning representations in neural networks? A lot, it turns out. Neural network model compression has become a topic of great interest in recent years, and many different techniques have been proposed to address this problem. In general, this is motivated by the idea that smaller models typically lead to better generalization. At the same time, the decision of what to prune and when to prune necessarily forces us to confront our assumptions about how neural networks actually learn to represent patterns in data. In this work we set out to test several long-held hypotheses about neural network learning representations and numerical approaches to pruning. To accomplish this we first reviewed the historical literature and derived a novel algorithm to prune whole neurons (as opposed to the traditional method of pruning weights) from optimally trained networks using a second-order Taylor method. We then set about testing the performance of our algorithm and analyzing the quality of the decisions it made. As a baseline for comparison we used a first-order Taylor method based on the Skeletonization algorithm and an exhaustive brute-force serial pruning algorithm. Our proposed algorithm worked well compared to a first-order method, but not nearly as well as the brute-force method. Our error analysis led us to question the validity of many widely-held assumptions behind pruning algorithms in general and the trade-offs we often make in the interest of reducing computational complexity. We discovered that there is a straightforward way, however expensive, to serially prune 40-70\% of the neurons in a trained network with minimal effect on the learning representation and without any re-training.","nwolfe@cs.cmu.edu, adityasharma@cmu.edu, drude@nt.upb.de, bhiksha@cs.cmu.edu","Nikolas Wolfe, Aditya Sharma, Lukas Drude, Bhiksha Raj","cs.cmu.edu, cmu.edu","Theory, Deep learning",BkV4VS9ll,wolfe|the_incredible_shrinking_neural_network_new_perspectives_on_learning_representations_through_the_lens_of_pruning,The Incredible Shrinking Neural Network: New Perspectives on Learning Representations Through The Lens of Pruning,Pruning algorithms reveal fundamental insights into neural network learning representations,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll&noteId=BkV4VS9ll,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BkV4VS9ll

"We introduce a generative model, we call Tensorial Mixture Models (TMMs) based on mixtures of basic
component distributions over local structures (e.g. patches in an image) where the dependencies between
the local-structures are represented by a ""priors tensor"" holding the prior probabilities of assigning a
component distribution to each local-structure.

In their general form, TMMs are intractable as the priors tensor is typically of exponential size. However,
when the priors tensor is decomposed it gives rise to an arithmetic circuit which in turn transforms the
TMM into a Convolutional Arithmetic Circuit (ConvAC). A ConvAC corresponds to a shallow (single hidden layer)
network when the priors tensor is decomposed by a CP (sum of rank-1) approach and corresponds to a
deep network when the decomposition follows the Hierarchical Tucker (HT) model.

The ConvAC representation of a TMM possesses several attractive properties. First, the inference is tractable
and is implemented by a forward pass through a deep network. Second, the architectural design of the model
follows the deep networks community design, i.e.,  the structure of TMMs is determined by just two easily
understood factors: size of pooling windows and number of channels. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model when tackling the problem of classification with missing data, leveraging TMMs unique ability of
tractable marginalization which leads to optimal classifiers regardless of the missingness distribution.","or.sharir@cs.huji.ac.il, ronent@cs.huji.ac.il, cohennadav@cs.huji.ac.il, shashua@cs.huji.ac.il","Or Sharir, Ronen Tamari, Nadav Cohen, Amnon Shashua","cs.huji.ac.il, mail.huji.ac.il","Deep learning, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning",BJluGHcee,sharir|tensorial_mixture_models,Tensorial Mixture Models,"A generative model realized through convolutional networks, which has the unique property of having both tractable inference and marginalization, showing state-of-the-art results on classification with missing data.",Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee&noteId=BJluGHcee,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJluGHcee

"Mastering a video game requires skill, tactics and strategy. While these attributes may be acquired naturally by human players, teaching them to a computer program is a far more challenging task. In recent years, extensive research was carriedout in the field of reinforcement learning and numerous algorithms were introduced, aiming to learn how to perform human tasks such as playing video games. As a result, the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) (Bellemare et al., 2013) has become a commonly used benchmark environment allowing algorithms to train on various Atari 2600 games. In many games the state-of-the-art algorithms outperform humans. In this paper we introduce a new learning environment, the Retro Learning Environment — RLE, that can run games on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Sega Genesis and several other gaming consoles. The environment is expandable, allowing for more video games and consoles to be easily added to the environment, while maintaining the same interface as ALE. Moreover, RLE is compatible with Python and Torch.

"Recurrent neural networks have shown their ability to construct sentence or paragraph representations. Variants such as LSTM overcome the problem of vanishing gradients to some degree, thus being able to model long-time dependency. Still, these recurrent based models lack the ability of capturing complex semantic compositions. To address this problem, we propose a model which can incorporate local contexts with the guide of global context attention. Both the local and global contexts are obtained through LSTM networks. The working procedure of this model is just like how we human beings read a text and then answer a related question. Empirical studies show that the proposed model can achieve state of the art on some benchmark datasets. Attention visualization also verifies our intuition.

"Despite recent advances, the remaining bottlenecks in deep generative models are necessity of extensive training and difficulties with generalization from small number of training examples.
Both problems may be addressed by conditional generative models that are trained to adapt the generative distribution to additional input data.
So far this idea was explored only under certain limitations such as restricting the input data to be a single object or multiple objects representing the same concept.  
In this work we develop a new class of deep generative model called generative matching networks which is inspired by the recently proposed matching networks for one-shot learning in discriminative tasks and the ideas from meta-learning.
By conditioning on the additional input dataset, generative matching networks may instantly learn new concepts that were not available during the training but conform to a similar generative process, without explicit limitations on the number of additional input objects or the number of concepts they represent. 
Our experiments on the Omniglot dataset demonstrate that generative matching networks can significantly improve predictive performance on the fly as more additional data is available to the model and also adapt the latent space which is beneficial in the context of feature extraction.","sbos.net@gmail.com, vetrovd@yandex.ru","Sergey Bartunov, Dmitry P.

"Lipreading is the task of decoding text from the movement of a speaker's mouth. Traditional approaches separated the problem into two stages: designing or learning visual features, and prediction. More recent deep lipreading approaches are end-to-end trainable (Wand et al., 2016; Chung & Zisserman, 2016a). However, existing work on models trained end-to-end perform only word classification, rather than sentence-level sequence prediction. Studies have shown that human lipreading performance increases for longer words (Easton & Basala, 1982), indicating the importance of features capturing temporal context in an ambiguous communication channel. Motivated by this observation, we present LipNet, a model that maps a variable-length sequence of video frames to text, making use of spatiotemporal convolutions, a recurrent network, and the connectionist temporal classification loss, trained entirely end-to-end. To the best of our knowledge, LipNet is the first end-to-end sentence-level lipreading model that simultaneously learns spatiotemporal visual features and a sequence model. On the GRID corpus, LipNet achieves 95.2% accuracy in sentence-level, overlapped speaker split task, outperforming experienced human lipreaders and the previous 86.4% word-level state-of-the-art accuracy (Gergen et al., 2016).","yannis.assael@cs.ox.ac.uk, brendan.shillingford@cs.ox.ac.uk, shimon.whiteson@cs.ox.ac.uk, nando.de.freitas@cs.ox.ac.uk","Yannis M.

"Neural networks are usually over-parameterized with significant redundancy in the number of required neurons which results in unnecessary computation and memory usage at inference time. One common approach to address this issue is to prune these big networks by removing extra neurons and parameters while maintaining the accuracy. In this paper, we propose NoiseOut, a fully automated pruning algorithm based on the correlation between activations of neurons in the hidden layers. We prove that adding additional output neurons with entirely random targets results into a higher correlation between neurons which makes pruning by NoiseOut even more efficient. Finally, we test our method on various networks

"Reading comprehension is a question answering task where the answer is to be found in a given passage about entities and events not mentioned in general knowledge sources.

"Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has been successful in learning sophisticated behaviors automatically; however, the learning process requires a huge number of trials. In contrast, animals can learn new tasks in just a few trials, benefiting from their prior knowledge about the world. This paper seeks to bridge this gap. Rather than designing a “fast” reinforcement learning algorithm, we propose to represent it as a recurrent neural network (RNN) and learn it from data. In our proposed method, RL^2, the algorithm is encoded in the weights of the RNN, which are learned slowly through a general-purpose (“slow”) RL algorithm. The RNN receives all information a typical RL algorithm would receive, including observations, actions, rewards, and termination flags; and it retains its state across episodes in a given Markov Decision Process (MDP). The activations of the RNN store the state of the “fast” RL algorithm on the current (previously unseen) MDP. We evaluate RL^2 experimentally on both small-scale and large-scale problems. On the small-scale side, we train it to solve randomly generated multi-arm bandit problems and finite MDPs. After RL^2 is trained, its performance on new MDPs is close to human-designed algorithms with optimality guarantees. On the large-scale side, we test RL^2 on a vision-based navigation task and show that it scales up to high-dimensional problems.","rocky@openai.com, joschu@openai.com, peter@openai.com, peter@berkeley.edu, ilyasu@openai.com, pieter@openai.com","Yan Duan, John Schulman, Xi Chen, Peter L.

"Existing deep networks are generally initialized with unsupervised methods, such as random assignments and greedy layerwise pre-training. This may result in the whole training process (initialization/pre-training + fine-tuning) to be very time consuming. In this paper, we combine the ideas of ensemble learning and deep learning, and present a novel deep learning framework called deep error-correcting output codes (DeepECOC). DeepECOC are composed of multiple layers of the ECOC module, which combines multiple binary classifiers for feature learning. Here, the weights learned for the binary classifiers can be considered as weights between two successive layers, while the outputs of the combined binary classifiers as the outputs of a hidden layer. On the one hand, the ECOC modules can be learned using given supervisory information, and on the other hand, based on the ternary coding design, the weights can be learned only using part of the training data. Hence, the supervised pre-training of DeepECOC is in general very effective and efficient. We have conducted extensive experiments to compare DeepECOC with traditional ECOC, feature learning and deep learning algorithms on several benchmark data sets. The results demonstrate that DeepECOC perform not only better than traditional ECOC and feature learning algorithms, but also state-of the-art deep learning models in most cases.","gqzhong@ouc.edu.cn, ouczyc@outlook.com, sdrzbruce@163.com, enri9615@outlook.com, dongjunyu@ouc.edu.cn","Guoqiang Zhong, Yuchen Zheng, Peng Zhang, Mengqi Li, Junyu Dong",ouc.edu.cn,,Hkz6aNqle,zhong|deep_errorcorrecting_output_codes,Deep Error-Correcting Output Codes,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkz6aNqle&noteId=Hkz6aNqle,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Hkz6aNqle

To evaluate the effectiveness of MDA, we have compared it with some feature learning methods and deep learning models on 7 small and middle scale real-world applications, including handwritten digits recognition, speech recognition, historical document understanding, image classification, action recognition and so on.

"We present two novel and contrasting Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architectures for extractive summarization of documents. The Classifier based architecture sequentially accepts or rejects each sentence in the original document order for its membership in the summary. The Selector architecture, on the other hand, is free to pick one sentence at a time in any arbitrary order to generate the extractive summary. 

Our models under both architectures jointly capture the notions of salience and redundancy of sentences.

"Tartan {TRT} a hardware accelerator for inference with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is presented and evaluated on Convolutional Neural Networks. TRT exploits the variable per layer precision requirements of DNNs to deliver execution time that is proportional to the precision p in bits used per layer for convolutional and fully-connected layers. Prior art has demonstrated an accelerator with the same execution performance only for convolutional layers. Experiments on image classification CNNs show that on average across all networks studied,  TRT outperforms a state-of-the-art bit-parallel accelerator by 1.90x without any loss in accuracy while it is 1.17x more energy efficient. TRT requires no network retraining while it enables trading off accuracy for additional improvements in execution performance and energy efficiency. For example, if a 1% relative loss in accuracy is acceptable, TRT is on average 2.04x faster and 1.25x more energy efficient than the bit-parallel accelerator.

"We build a machine solver for word problems on the physics of a free
falling object under constant acceleration of gravity.  Each problem
consists of a formulation part, describing the setting, and a question
part asking for the value of an unknown.  Our solver consists of
two long short-term memory recurrent neural networks and a numerical
integrator. The first neural network (the labeler) labels each
word of the problem, identifying the physical parameters and the
question part of the problem. The second neural network (the 
classifier) identifies what is being asked in the question. Using
the information extracted by both networks, the numerical integrator
computes the solution.  We observe that the classifier is resilient
to errors made by the labeler, which does a better job of identifying
the physics parameters than the question. Training, validation and test

For example, our model is able to detect spoken instances of the words ``lighthouse'' within an utterance and associate them with image regions containing lighthouses. We do not use any form of conventional automatic speech recognition, nor do we use any text transcriptions or conventional linguistic annotations.

"Recent advances in neural variational inference have facilitated efficient training of powerful directed graphical models with continuous latent variables, such as variational autoencoders. However, these models usually assume simple, uni-modal priors — such as the multivariate Gaussian distribution — yet many real-world data distributions are highly complex and multi-modal. Examples of complex and multi-modal distributions range from topics in newswire text to conversational dialogue responses. When such latent variable models are applied to these domains, the restriction of the simple, uni-modal prior hinders the overall expressivity of the learned model as it cannot possibly capture more complex aspects of the data distribution. To overcome this critical restriction, we propose a flexible, simple prior distribution which can be learned efficiently and potentially capture an exponential number of modes of a target distribution. We develop the multi-modal variational encoder-decoder framework and investigate the effectiveness of the proposed prior in several natural language processing modeling tasks, including document modeling and dialogue modeling.","julianserban@gmail.com, ago109@psu.edu, jpineau@cs.mcgill.ca, aaron.courville@umontreal.ca","Iulian V.

"Deep neural networks are powerful and popular learning models that achieve state-of-the-art pattern recognition performance on many computer vision, speech, and language processing tasks. However, these networks have also been shown susceptible to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations which force misclassification of the inputs. Adversarial examples enable adversaries to subvert the expected system behavior leading to undesired consequences and could pose a security risk when these systems are deployed in the real world.

In this work, we focus on deep convolutional neural networks and demonstrate that adversaries can easily craft adversarial examples even without any internal knowledge of the target network. Our attacks treat the network as an oracle (black-box) and only assume that the output of the network can be observed on the probed inputs. Our first attack is based on a simple idea of adding perturbation to a randomly selected single pixel or a small set of them. We then improve the effectiveness of this attack by carefully constructing a small set of pixels to perturb by using the idea of greedy local-search. Our proposed attacks also naturally extend to a stronger notion of misclassification. Our extensive experimental results illustrate that even these elementary attacks can reveal a deep neural network's vulnerabilities. The simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed schemes mean that they could serve as a litmus test while designing robust networks.","n.narodytska@gmail.com, kaivisw@gmail.com","Nina Narodytska, Shiva Kasiviswanathan",samsung.com,"Computer vision, Deep learning",SJCscQcge,narodytska|simple_blackbox_adversarial_perturbations_for_deep_networks,Simple Black-Box Adversarial Perturbations for Deep Networks,"Simple, but highly effective, adversarial attacks on deep neural networks even in the absence of any internal knowledge about the network",Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJCscQcge&noteId=SJCscQcge,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJCscQcge

"Understanding the communication between different animals by analysing their acoustic signals is an important topic in bioacoustics. It can be a powerful tool for the preservation of ecological diversity. We investigate probabilistic models to analyse signals issued from real-world bioacoustic sound scenes. We study a Bayesian non-parametric sequential models based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models (HDP-HMM). The model is able to infer hidden states, that are referred here as song units. However, using such a model raise one main issue: defining the number of hidden states the model has to learn. In bioacoustic problems we often do not know the number of song units (unlike in human speech recognition). Hence, we work with the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP)-HMM, which is a Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) model that offers a way to tackle this challenging problem. We focus our work on unsupervised learning from bioacoustic data. It consists in simultaneously finding the structure of hidden song units and automatically infer the unknown number of the hidden states to represent the data. Two real bioacoustic sound scene applications are investigated in this work: on whale and multi-species birds segmentation. The learning of these models is proceeded by using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) of audio signals. The results show an interesting song unit segmentation of the bioacoustic signals and open new insights for unsupervised analysis of such signals. This paper illustrates the potential of chunking non-human animal signals into structured parts. This can yield to a new species representation and help experts to better understand the behaviour of such species as Kershenbaum et al. (2014) wanted.","vincent-roger@etud.univ-tln.fr, marius.bartcus@gmail.com, faicel.chamroukhi@unicaen.fr, glotin@univ-tln.fr","Vincent Roger, Marius Bartcus, Faicel Chamroukhi, Hervé Glotin",no conflict : common direction of Phd thesis,,Hk1l9Xqxe,roger|bioacoustic_segmentation_by_hierarchical_dirichlet_process_hidden_markov_model,BIOACOUSTIC SEGMENTATION BY HIERARCHICAL DIRICHLET PROCESS HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1l9Xqxe&noteId=Hk1l9Xqxe,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Hk1l9Xqxe

In this paper, we focus on this answer extraction task, presenting a novel model architecture that efficiently builds fixed length representations of all spans in the evidence document with a recurrent network.

"In this paper, we show that the recent integration of statistical models with recurrent neural networks provides a new way of formulating volatility models that have been popular in time series analysis and prediction. The model comprises a pair of complementary stochastic recurrent neural networks: the generative network models the joint distribution of the stochastic volatility process; the inference network approximates the conditional distribution of the latent variables given the observable ones.
Our focus in this paper is on the formulation of temporal dynamics of volatility over time under a stochastic recurrent neural network framework. Our derivations show that some popular volatility models are a special case of our proposed neural stochastic volatility model. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model generates a smoother volatility estimation, and largely outperforms a widely used GARCH model on several metrics about the fitness of the volatility modelling and the accuracy of the prediction.","r.luo@cs.ucl.ac.uk, xuxj@apex.sjtu.edu.cn, wnzhang@apex.sjtu.edu.cn, j.wang@cs.ucl.ac.uk","Rui Luo, Xiaojun Xu, Weinan Zhang, Jun Wang","cs.ucl.ac.uk, apex.sjtu.edu.cn","Deep learning, Supervised Learning",B1IzH7cxl,luo|a_neural_stochastic_volatility_model,A Neural Stochastic Volatility Model,A novel integration of statistical models with recurrent neural networks providing a new way of formulating volatility models.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1IzH7cxl&noteId=B1IzH7cxl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1IzH7cxl
"The activation function is an important component in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For instance, recent breakthroughs in Deep Learning can be attributed to the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Another recently proposed activation function, the Exponential Linear Unit (ELU), has the supplementary property of reducing bias shift without explicitly centering the values at zero. In this paper, we show that learning a parameterization of ELU improves its performance. We analyzed our proposed Parametric ELU (PELU) in the context of vanishing gradients and provide a gradient-based optimization framework. We conducted several experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet with different network architectures, such as NiN, Overfeat, All-CNN and ResNet. Our results show that our PELU has relative error improvements over ELU of 4.45% and 5.68% on CIFAR-10 and 100, and as much as 7.28% with only 0.0003% parameter increase on ImageNet. We also observed that Vgg using PELU tended to prefer activations saturating closer to zero, as in ReLU, except at the last layer, which saturated near -2. Finally, other presented results suggest that varying the shape of the activations during training along with the other parameters helps controlling vanishing gradients and bias shift, thus facilitating learning.","ludovic.trottier.1@ulaval.ca, philippe.giguere@ift.ulaval.ca, brahim.chaib-draa@ift.ulaval.ca","Ludovic Trottier, Philippe Giguère, Brahim Chaib-draa","ulaval.ca, ift.ulaval.ca",,Bkepl7cee,trottier|parametric_exponential_linear_unit_for_deep_convolutional_neural_networks,Parametric Exponential Linear Unit for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,Learning a parameterization of the ELU activation function improves its performance.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee&noteId=Bkepl7cee,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Bkepl7cee
"Our understanding of the world depends highly on how we represent it.  Using background knowledge about its complex underlying physical rules, our brain can produce intuitive and simplified representations which it can easily use to solve problems. The approach of this paper aims to reproduce this simplification process using a neural network to produce a simple low dimensional state representation of the world from images acquired by a robot. As proposed in Jonschkowski & Brock (2015), we train the neural network in an unsupervised way, using the ""a priori"" knowledge we have about the world as loss functions called ""robotic priors"" that we implemented through a siamese network. This approach has been used to learn a one dimension representation of a Baxter head position from raw images. The experiment resulted in a 97,7% correlation between the learned representation and the ground truth, and show that relevant visual features form the environment are learned.","timothee.lesort@ensta-paristech.fr, david.filliat@ensta-paristech.fr","Timothee LESORT, David FILLIAT","ensta-paristech.fr, cpe.fr, umontreal.ca","Deep learning, Computer vision, Unsupervised Learning",Bkp_y7qxe,lesort|unsupervised_deep_learning_of_state_representation_using_robotic_priors_,Unsupervised Deep Learning of State Representation Using Robotic Priors ,This paper introduces a method for training a deep neural network to learn a  representation of a robot's environment state using a priori knowledge.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkp_y7qxe&noteId=Bkp_y7qxe,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Bkp_y7qxe
"The learning capability of a neural network improves with increasing depth at
higher computational costs. Wider layers with dense kernel connectivity patterns
further increase this cost and may hinder real-time inference. We propose feature
map and kernel level pruning for reducing the computational complexity of
a deep convolutional neural network. Pruning feature maps reduces the width
of a layer and hence does not need any sparse representation. Further, kernel
pruning changes the dense connectivity pattern into a sparse one. Due to coarse
nature, these pruning granularities can be exploited by GPUs and VLSI based
implementations. We propose a simple strategy to choose the least adversarial
pruning masks. The proposed approach is generic and can select good pruning
masks for feature map, kernel and intra-kernel pruning. The pruning masks are
generated randomly, and the best performing one is selected using the evaluation
set. The sufficient number of random pruning masks to try depends on the pruning
ratio, and is around 100 when 40% complexity reduction is needed. The pruned
network is retrained to compensate for the loss in accuracy. We have extensively
evaluated the proposed approach with the CIFAR-10, SVHN and MNIST datasets.
Experiments with the CIFAR-10 dataset show that more than 85% sparsity can be

"The impressive performance and plasticity of convolutional neural networks to solve different vision problems are shadowed by their black-box nature and its consequent lack of full understanding. To reduce this gap we propose to describe the activity of individual neurons by quantifiyng their inherent selectivity to specific properties. Our approach is based on the definition of feature selectivity indexes that allow the ranking of neurons according to specific properties. Here we report the results of exploring selectivity indexes for: (a) an image feature (color); and (b) an image label (class membership). Our contribution is a framework to seek or classify neurons by indexing on these selectivity properties. It helps to find color selective neurons, such as a red-mushroom neuron in layer conv4 or class selective neurons such as dog-face neurons in layer conv5, and establishes a methodology to derive other selectivity properties.  Indexing on neuron selectivity can statistically draw how features and classes are represented through layers at a moment when the size of trained nets is growing and automatic tools to index can be helpful.","ivet.rafegas@uab.cat, maria.vanrell@uab.cat, lfbaa@ubi.pt","Ivet Rafegas, Maria Vanrell, Luís A.

"We propose a multiagent system that have feedforward networks as its subset

One of the largest difference from human brain is the use of matrix-vector multiplication based on layer architecture.

than units aligned in column vectors and manipulated by global level algorithm.
Therefore we suppose that it is an effective approach for developing more biologically plausible model while preserving compatibility with deep networks to alternate units with multiple agents.

Inspired by Word2Vec, the distributed representation for natural language, we propose Cat2Vec (categories to vectors) model. In Cat2Vec, a low-dimensional continuous vector is automatically learned for each category in each field. The interactions among inter-field categories are further explored by different neural gates and the most informative ones are selected by pooling layers. In our experiments, with the exploration of the interactions between pairwise categories over layers, the model attains great improvement over state-of-the-art models in a supervised learning task, e.g., click prediction, while capturing the most significant interactions from the data.","ying.wen@cs.ucl.ac.uk, jun.wang@cs.ucl.ac.uk, tychen@apex.sjtu.edu.cn, wnzhang@apex.sjtu.edu.cn","Ying Wen, Jun Wang, Tianyao Chen, Weinan Zhang","ucl.ac.uk, sjtu.eud.cn","Unsupervised Learning, Deep learning, Applications",HyNxRZ9xg,wen|cat2vec_learning_distributed_representation_of_multifield_categorical_data,Cat2Vec: Learning Distributed Representation of Multi-field Categorical Data,an unsupervised pairwise interaction model to learning the distributed representation of multi-field categorical data,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg&noteId=HyNxRZ9xg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HyNxRZ9xg
"A fundamental problem faced by object recognition systems is that
objects and their features can appear in different locations, scales
and orientations. Current deep learning methods attempt to achieve
invariance to local translations via pooling, discarding the locations
of features in the process.  Other approaches explicitly learn
transformed versions of the same feature, leading to representations
that quickly explode in size. Instead of discarding the rich and
useful information about feature transformations to achieve
invariance, we argue that models should learn object features
conjointly with their transformations to achieve equivariance.  We
propose a new model of unsupervised learning based on sparse coding
that can learn object features jointly with their affine
transformations directly from images. Results based on learning from
natural images indicate that our approach
matches the reconstruction quality of traditional sparse coding but
with significantly fewer degrees of freedom while simultaneously
learning transformations from data. These results open the door to
scaling up unsupervised learning to allow deep feature+transformation

For decoding, we decomposed each word of a large vocabulary into the set of
constituent bigrams, and apply a simple cosine similarity measure between this 
representation and the bagged RNN prediction to retrieve the vocabulary word. 
We compare this method to standard word recognition techniques based on 
sequential character recognition.

"As deep neural networks (DNNs) are applied to increasingly challenging problems, they will need to be able to represent their own uncertainty. Modelling uncertainty is one of the key features of Bayesian methods. Bayesian DNNs that use dropout-based variational distributions and scale to complex tasks have recently been proposed. We evaluate Bayesian DNNs trained with Bernoulli or Gaussian multiplicative masking of either the units (dropout) or the weights (dropconnect). We compare these Bayesian DNNs ability to represent their uncertainty about their outputs through sampling during inference. We tested the calibration of these Bayesian fully connected and convolutional DNNs on two visual inference tasks (MNIST and CIFAR-10). By adding different levels of Gaussian noise to the test images, we assessed how these DNNs represented their uncertainty about regions of input space not covered by the training set. These Bayesian DNNs represented their own uncertainty more accurately than traditional DNNs with a softmax output. We find that sampling of weights, whether Gaussian or Bernoulli, led to more accurate representation of uncertainty compared to sampling of units. However, sampling units using either Gaussian or Bernoulli dropout led to increased convolutional neural network (CNN) classification accuracy. Based on these findings we use both Bernoulli dropout and Gaussian dropconnect concurrently, which approximates the use of a spike-and-slab variational distribution. We find that networks with spike-and-slab sampling combine the advantages of the other methods: they classify with high accuracy and robustly represent the uncertainty of their classifications for all tested architectures.","Patrick.McClure@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk, Nikolaus.Kriegeskorte@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk","Patrick McClure, Nikolaus Kriegeskorte",cam.ac.uk,"Deep learning, Theory, Applications",HJ1JBJ5gl,mcclure|representing_inferential_uncertainty_in_deep_neural_networks_through_sampling,Representing inferential uncertainty in deep neural networks through sampling,Dropout- and dropconnect-based Bayesian deep neural networks with sampling at inference better represent their own inferential uncertainty than traditional deep neural networks.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl&noteId=HJ1JBJ5gl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJ1JBJ5gl
"It has been believed that stochastic feedforward neural networks (SFNN) have several advantages beyond deterministic deep neural networks (DNN): they have more expressive power allowing multi-modal mappings and regularize better due to their stochastic nature. However, training SFNN is notoriously harder. In this paper, we aim at developing efficient training methods for large-scale SFNN, in particular using known architectures and pre-trained parameters of DNN. To this end, we propose a new intermediate stochastic model, called Simplified-SFNN, which can be built upon any baseline DNN and approximates certain SFNN by simplifying its upper latent units above stochastic ones. The main novelty of our approach is in establishing the connection between three models, i.e., DNN
-> Simplified-SFNN -> SFNN, which naturally leads to an efficient training procedure of the stochastic models utilizing pre-trained parameters of DNN. Using several popular DNNs, we show how they can be effectively transferred to the corresponding stochastic models for both multi-modal and classification tasks on MNIST, TFD, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets. In particular, our stochastic model built from the wide residual network has 28 layers and 36 million parameters, where the former consistently outperforms the latter for the classification tasks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 due to its stochastic regularizing effect.","kiminlee@kaist.ac.kr, jaehyungkim@kaist.ac.kr, songchong@kaist.edu, jinwoos@kaist.ac.kr","Kimin Lee, Jaehyung Kim, Song Chong, Jinwoo Shin","kaist.ac.kr, kaist.edu","Deep learning, Multi-modal learning, Structured prediction",B1akgy9xx,lee|making_stochastic_neural_networks_from_deterministic_ones,Making Stochastic Neural Networks from Deterministic Ones,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1akgy9xx&noteId=B1akgy9xx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1akgy9xx
"We introduce Information Dropout, a generalization of dropout that is motivated by the Information Bottleneck principle and highlights the way in which injecting noise in the activations can help in learning optimal representations of the data. Information Dropout is rooted in information theoretic principles, it includes as special cases several existing dropout methods, like Gaussian Dropout and Variational Dropout, and, unlike classical dropout, it can learn and build representations that are invariant to nuisances of the data, like occlusions and clutter. When the task is the reconstruction of the input, we show that the information dropout method yields a variational autoencoder as a special case, thus providing a link between representation learning, information theory and variational inference. Our experiments validate the theoretical intuitions behind our method, and we find that information dropout achieves a comparable or better generalization performance than binary dropout, especially on smaller models, since it can automatically adapt the noise to the structure of the network, as well as to the test sample.","achille@cs.ucla.edu, soatto@cs.ucla.edu","Alessandro Achille, Stefano Soatto","cs.ucla.edu, ucla.edu","Theory, Deep learning",BJa0ECFxe,achille|information_dropout_learning_optimal_representations_through_noise,Information Dropout: learning optimal representations through noise,"We introduce Information Dropout, an information theoretic generalization of dropout that highlights how injecting noise can help in learning invariant representations.",Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJa0ECFxe&noteId=BJa0ECFxe,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJa0ECFxe
"Teaching a computer to read a document and answer general questions pertaining to the document is a challenging yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we describe a novel neural network architecture called Reasoning Network ({ReasoNet}) for machine comprehension tasks. ReasoNet makes use of multiple turns to effectively exploit and then reason over the relation among queries, documents, and answers. Different from previous approaches using a fixed number of turns during inference, ReasoNet introduces a termination state to relax this constraint on the reasoning depth. With the use of reinforcement learning, ReasoNet can dynamically determine whether to continue the comprehension process after digesting intermediate results, or to terminate reading when it concludes that existing information is adequate to produce an answer. ReasoNet has achieved state-of-the-art performance in machine comprehension datasets, including unstructured CNN and Daily Mail datasets, and a structured Graph Reachability dataset.","yeshen@microsoft.com, pshuang@microsoft.com, jfgao@microsoft.com, wzchen@microsoft.com","Yelong Shen, Po-Sen Huang, Jianfeng Gao, Weizhu Chen",microsoft.com,"Deep learning, Natural language processing",BJlxmAKlg,shen|reasonet_learning_to_stop_reading_in_machine_comprehension,ReasoNet: Learning to Stop Reading in Machine Comprehension,ReasoNet Reader for machine reading and comprehension,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg&noteId=BJlxmAKlg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJlxmAKlg
"Recent progress in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled to tackle bigger and more challenging tasks. However, the increasing complexity of the problems, as well as the use of more sophisticated models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), impedes the understanding of artificial agents behavior. In this work, we present the Semi-Aggregated Markov Decision Process (SAMDP) model. The purpose of the SAMDP modeling is to describe and allow a better understanding of complex behaviors by identifying temporal and spatial abstractions. In contrast to other modeling approaches, SAMDP is built in a transformed state-space that encodes the dynamics of the problem. We show that working with the \emph{right} state representation mitigates the problem of finding spatial and temporal abstractions. We describe the process of building the SAMDP model from observed trajectories and give examples for using it in a toy problem and complicated DQN policies. Finally, we show how using the SAMDP we can monitor the policy at hand and make it more robust.","nirb@campus.technion.ac.il, tomzahavy@campus.technion.ac.il, shie@ee.technion.ac.il","Nir Baram, Tom Zahavy, Shie Mannor",technion.ac.il,"Reinforcement Learning, Deep learning",r1yjkAtxe,baram|spatiotemporal_abstractions_in_reinforcement_learning_through_neural_encoding,Spatio-Temporal Abstractions in Reinforcement Learning Through Neural Encoding,A method for understanding and improving deep agents by creating spatio-temporal abstractions,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1yjkAtxe&noteId=r1yjkAtxe,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1yjkAtxe

The complex temporal dependencies between the variables combined with sparsity of the data makes the event classification problem particularly challenging.

In this work, we propose and compare three representation learning algorithms over symbolized sequences which enables classification of heterogeneous time-series data using a deep architecture.

We also evaluate their precision in transfer learning settings, where binary codes are inferred for documents unrelated to the training corpus. Results from these experiments indicate that binary paragraph vectors can capture semantics relevant for various domain-specific documents.

"The recently introduced Paragraph Vector is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed representations for pieces of texts. However, an inherent limitation of Paragraph Vector is lack of ability to infer distributed representations for texts outside of the training set. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Generative Paragraph Vector, which can be viewed as a probabilistic extension of the Distributed Bag of Words version of Paragraph Vector with a complete generative process. With the ability to infer the distributed representations for unseen texts, we can further incorporate text labels into the model and turn it into a supervised version, namely Supervised Generative Paragraph Vector. In this way, we can leverage the labels paired with the texts to guide the representation learning, and employ the learned model for prediction tasks directly. Experiments on five text classification benchmark collections show that both model architectures can yield superior classification performance over the state-of-the-art counterparts.","zhangruqing@software.ict.ac.cn, guojiafeng@ict.ac.cn, lanyanyan@ict.ac.cn, junxu@ict.ac.cn, cxq@ict.ac.cn","Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Yanyan Lan, Jun Xu, Xueqi Cheng",ict.ac.cn,"Natural language processing, Deep learning, Unsupervised Learning, Supervised Learning",ryT9R3Yxe,zhang|generative_paragraph_vector,Generative Paragraph Vector,"With a complete generative process, our models are able to infer vector representations as well as labels over unseen texts.",Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe&noteId=ryT9R3Yxe,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryT9R3Yxe

In this paper, we propose a system-call language-modeling approach for designing anomaly-based host intrusion detection systems. To remedy the issue of high false-alarm rates commonly arising in conventional methods, we employ a novel ensemble method that blends multiple thresholding classifiers into a single one, making it possible to accumulate `highly normal' sequences. The proposed system-call language model has various advantages leveraged by the fact that it can learn the semantic meaning and interactions of each system call that existing methods cannot effectively consider. Through diverse experiments on public benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, we show that our model possesses high portability, which is one of the key aspects of realizing successful intrusion detection systems.","kgwmath@snu.ac.kr, hyyi@snu.ac.kr, ubuntu@snu.ac.kr, ypaek@snu.ac.kr, sryoon@snu.ac.kr","Gyuwan Kim, Hayoon Yi, Jangho Lee, Yunheung Paek, Sungroh Yoon",snu.ac.kr,,rksfwnFxl,kim|lstmbased_systemcall_language_modeling_and_ensemble_method_for_hostbased_intrusion_detection,LSTM-Based System-Call Language Modeling and Ensemble Method for Host-Based Intrusion Detection,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=rksfwnFxl&noteId=rksfwnFxl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rksfwnFxl
"We present deep variational canonical correlation analysis (VCCA), a deep multi-view learning model that extends the latent variable model interpretation of linear CCA~\citep{BachJordan05a} to nonlinear observation models parameterized by deep neural networks (DNNs). Computing the marginal data likelihood, as well as inference of the latent variables, are intractable under this model. We derive a variational lower bound of the data likelihood by parameterizing the posterior density of the latent variables with another DNN, and approximate the lower bound via Monte Carlo sampling. Interestingly, the resulting model resembles that of multi-view autoencoders~\citep{Ngiam_11b}, with the key distinction of an additional sampling procedure at the bottleneck layer. We also propose a variant of VCCA called VCCA-private which can, in addition to the ``common variables'' underlying both views, extract the ``private variables'' within each view. We demonstrate that VCCA-private is able to disentangle the shared and private information for multi-view data without hard supervision.","weiranwang@ttic.edu, xcyan@umich.edu, honglak@umich.edu, klivescu@ttic.edu","Weiran Wang, Xinchen Yan, Honglak Lee, Karen Livescu","ucmerced.edu, ttic.edu, umich.edu",,H1Heentlx,wang|deep_variational_canonical_correlation_analysis,Deep Variational Canonical Correlation Analysis,A deep generative model for multi-view representation learning,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx&noteId=H1Heentlx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H1Heentlx
"Consider an ill-posed inverse problem of estimating causal factors from observations, one of which is known to lie near some (unknown) low-dimensional, non-linear manifold expressed by a predefined Mercer-kernel. Solving this problem requires simultaneous estimation of these factors and learning the low-dimensional representation for them. In this work, we introduce a novel non-linear dimensionality regularization technique for solving such problems without pre-training.
We re-formulate Kernel-PCA as an energy minimization problem in which low dimensionality constraints are introduced as regularization terms in the energy.
To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to create a dimensionality regularizer in the KPCA framework. Our approach relies on robustly penalizing the rank of the recovered factors directly in the implicit feature space to create
their low-dimensional approximations in closed form. Our approach performs robust KPCA in the presence of missing data and noise.

"Deep neural networks (DNN) have shown unprecedented success in various computer vision applications such as image classification and object detection. However, it is still a common annoyance during the training phase, that one has to prepare at least thousands of labeled images to fine-tune a network to a specific domain. Recent study shows that a DNN has strong dependency towards the training dataset, and the learned features cannot be easily transferred to a different but relevant task without fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful remedy, called Adaptive Batch Normalization (AdaBN) to increase the generalization ability of a DNN. By modulating the statistics from the source domain to the target domain in all Batch Normalization layers across the network, our approach achieves deep adaptation effect for domain adaptation tasks. In contrary to other deep learning domain adaptation methods, our method does not require additional components, and is parameter-free. It archives state-of-the-art performance despite its surprising simplicity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is complementary with other existing methods. Combining AdaBN with existing domain adaptation treatments may further improve model performance.","lyttonhao@pku.edu.cn, winsty@gmail.com, shijianping5000@gmail.com, liujiaying@pku.edu.cn, xiaodi.hou@gmail.com","Yanghao Li, Naiyan Wang, Jianping Shi, Jiaying Liu, Xiaodi Hou",pku.edu.cn,,BJuysoFeg,li|revisiting_batch_normalization_for_practical_domain_adaptation,Revisiting Batch Normalization For Practical Domain Adaptation,We propose a simple yet effective approach for domain adaptation on batch normalized neural networks.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg&noteId=BJuysoFeg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJuysoFeg
"Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510x smaller than AlexNet).","forresti@eecs.berkeley.edu, songhan@stanford.edu, moskewcz@eecs.berkeley.edu, kashraf@eecs.berkeley.edu, dally@stanford.edu, keutzer@eecs.berkeley.edu","Forrest N.

"Prior work has demonstrated that exploiting the sparsity can dramatically improve the energy efficiency and shrink the memory footprint of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
However, these sparsity-centric optimization techniques might be less effective for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially for the training phase, because of the significant structural difference between the neurons. To investigate if there is possible sparsity-centric optimization for training LSTM-based RNNs, we studied several applications and observed that there is potential sparsity in the gradients generated in the backward propagation. In this paper, we illustrate why the sparsity exists and propose a simple yet effective thresholding technique to induce further more sparsity during training an LSTM-based RNN training. Experiment results show that the proposed technique can increase the sparsity of linear gate gradients to higher than 80\% without loss of performance, which makes more than 50\% multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations redundant in an entire LSTM training process. These redudant MAC operations can be eliminated by hardware techniques to improve the energy efficiency and training speed of LSTM-based RNNs.","maohuazhu@ece.ucsb.edu, mrhu@nvidia.com, jclemons@nvidia.com, skeckler@nvidia.com, yuanxie@ece.ucsb.edu","Maohua Zhu, Minsoo Rhu, Jason Clemons, Stephen W.

"Many powerful machine learning models are based on the composition of multiple processing layers, such as deep nets, which gives rise to nonconvex objective functions. A general, recent approach to optimise such ""nested"" functions is the ""method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC)"". MAC introduces an auxiliary coordinate for each data point in order to decouple the nested model into independent submodels. This decomposes the optimisation into steps that alternate between training single layers and updating the coordinates. It has the advantage that it reuses existing single-layer algorithms, introduces parallelism, and does not need to use chain-rule gradients, so it works with nondifferentiable layers. We describe ParMAC, a distributed-computation model for MAC. This trains on a dataset distributed across machines while limiting the amount of communication so it does not obliterate the benefit of parallelism. ParMAC works on a cluster of machines with a circular topology and alternates two steps until convergence: one step trains the submodels in parallel using stochastic updates, and the other trains the coordinates in parallel. Only submodel parameters, no data or coordinates, are ever communicated between machines. ParMAC exhibits high parallelism, low communication overhead, and facilitates data shuffling, load balancing, fault tolerance and streaming data processing. We study the convergence of ParMAC and its parallel speedup, and implement ParMAC using MPI to learn binary autoencoders for fast image retrieval, achieving nearly perfect speedups in a 128-processor cluster with a training set of 100 million high-dimensional points.","mcarreira-perpinan@ucmerced.edu, malizadeh@ucmerced.edu","Miguel A.

"We study the expressive power of deep neural networks before and after
training. Considering neural nets after random initialization, we show that
three natural measures of expressivity all display an exponential dependence
on the depth of the network. We prove, theoretically and experimentally,
that all of these measures are in fact related to a fourth quantity, trajectory
length. This quantity grows exponentially in the depth of the network, and
is responsible for the depth sensitivity observed. These results translate
to consequences for networks during and after training. They suggest that
parameters earlier in a network have greater influence on its expressive power
– in particular, given a layer, its influence on expressivity is determined by
the remaining depth of the network after that layer. This is verified with
experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We also explore the effect of training

The augmentation introduces only one extra parameter per layer, and provides easier optimization by making degeneration into identity mappings simpler. Experimental results show that augmenting layers provides better optimization, increased performance, and more layer independence. We evaluate our method on MNIST using fully-connected networks, showing empirical indications that our augmentation facilitates the optimization of deep models, and that it provides high tolerance to full layer removal: the model retains over 90% of its performance even after half of its layers have been randomly removed. In our experiments, augmented plain networks -- which can be interpreted as simplified Highway Neural Networks -- outperform ResNets, raising new questions on how shortcut connections should be designed. We also evaluate our model on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using augmented Wide ResNets, achieving 3.65% and 18.27% test error, respectively.","savarese@land.ufrj.br, leonardomazza@poli.ufrj.br, daniel@land.ufrj.br","Pedro H.

"Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a well-known method for regression and classification tasks. However, it is an inherently sequential algorithm — at each step, the processing of the current example depends on the parameters learned from the previous examples. Prior approaches to parallelizing SGD, such as Hogwild! and AllReduce, do not honor these dependences across threads and thus can potentially suffer poor convergence rates and/or poor scalability. This paper proposes SymSGD, a parallel SGD algorithm that retains the sequential semantics of SGD in expectation. Each thread in this approach learns a local model and a probabilistic model combiner that allows the local models to be combined to produce the same result as what a sequential SGD would have produced, in expectation. This SymSGD approach is applicable to any linear learner whose update rule is linear. This paper evaluates SymSGD’s accuracy and performance on 9 datasets on a shared-memory machine shows up-to 13× speedup over our heavily optimized sequential baseline on 16 cores.","saemal@microsoft.com, madanm@microsoft.com, toddm@microsoft.com, yding8@ncsu.edu","Saeed Maleki, Madanlal Musuvathi, Todd Mytkowicz, Yufei Ding","microsoft.com, illinois.edu, ncsu.edu",,Sy1rwtKxg,maleki|parallel_stochastic_gradient_descent_with_sound_combiners,Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent with Sound Combiners,"This paper proposes SymSGD, a parallel SGD algorithm that retains the sequential semantics of SGD in expectation.",Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg&noteId=Sy1rwtKxg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy1rwtKxg
"We consider the learning of algorithmic tasks by mere observation of input-output pairs. 
Rather than studying this as a black-box discrete regression problem with no assumption whatsoever 
on the input-output mapping, we concentrate on tasks that are amenable to the principle of divide and conquer, and study what are its implications in terms of learning. 

This principle creates a powerful inductive bias that we exploit with neural architectures that are defined recursively, by learning two scale-invariant atomic operators: how to split a given input into two disjoint sets, and how to merge two partially solved tasks into a larger partial solution. The scale invariance creates parameter sharing across all stages of the architecture, and the dynamic design creates architectures whose complexity can be tuned in a differentiable manner.

As a result, our model is trained by backpropagation not only to minimize the errors at the output, but also to do so as efficiently as possible, by enforcing shallower computation graphs. Moreover, thanks to the scale invariance, the model can be trained only with only input/output pairs, removing the need to know oracle intermediate split and merge decisions. As it turns out, accuracy and complexity are not independent qualities, and we verify empirically that when the learnt complexity matches the underlying complexity of the task, this results in higher accuracy and better generalization in two paradigmatic problems: sorting and finding planar convex hulls.","anv273@nyu.edu, bruna@cims.nyu.edu","Alex Nowak, Joan Bruna","nyu.edu, berkeley.edu, fb.com",Deep learning,Hy3_KuYxg,nowak|divide_and_conquer_with_neural_networks,Divide and Conquer with Neural Networks,learn dynamic programming with neural networks,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg&noteId=Hy3_KuYxg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Hy3_KuYxg
"Gradients have been used to quantify feature importance in machine learning models. Unfortunately, in nonlinear deep networks, not only individual neurons but also the whole network can saturate, and as a result an important input feature can have a tiny gradient. We study various networks, and observe that this phenomena is indeed widespread, across many inputs.

We propose to examine interior gradients, which are gradients of counterfactual inputs constructed by scaling down the original input. We apply our method to the GoogleNet architecture for object recognition in images, as well as a ligand-based virtual screening network with categorical features and an LSTM based language model for the Penn Treebank dataset. We visualize how interior gradients better capture feature importance. Furthermore, interior gradients are applicable to a wide variety of deep networks, and have the attribution property that the feature importance scores sum to the the prediction score. 

Best of all, interior gradients can be computed just as easily as gradients. In contrast, previous methods are complex to implement, which hinders practical adoption.","mukunds@google.com, ataly@google.com, qiqiyan@google.com","Mukund Sundararajan, Ankur Taly, Qiqi Yan",google.com,"Deep learning, Computer vision, Theory",rJzaDdYxx,sundararajan|gradients_of_counterfactuals,Gradients of Counterfactuals,A method for identifying feature importance in deep networks using gradients of counterfactual inputs,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx&noteId=rJzaDdYxx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJzaDdYxx

"Recent research in the deep learning field has produced a plethora of new architectures.  At the same time, a growing number of groups are applying deep learning to new applications.  Some of these groups are likely to be composed of inexperienced deep learning practitioners who are baffled by the dizzying array of architecture choices and therefore opt to use an older architecture (i.e., Alexnet).  Here we attempt to bridge this gap by mining the collective knowledge contained in recent deep learning research to discover underlying principles for designing neural network architectures.

"Low-shot visual learning, the ability to recognize novel object categories from very few, or even one example, is a hallmark of human visual intelligence. Though successful on many tasks, deep learning approaches tends to be notoriously data-hungry. Recently, feature penalty regularization has been proved effective on capturing new concepts. In this work, we provide both empirical evidence and theoretical analysis on how and why these methods work. We also propose a better design of cost function with improved performance. Close scrutiny reveals the centering effect of feature representation, as well as the intrinsic connection with batch normalization.

"To use deep reinforcement learning in the wild, we might hope for an agent that can avoid catastrophic mistakes. Unfortunately, even in simple environments, the popular deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm is doomed by a Sisyphean curse. Owing to the use of function approximation, these agents eventually forget experiences as they become exceedingly unlikely under a new policy. Consequently, for as long as they continue to train, DQNs may periodically relive catastrophic mistakes. Many real-world environments where people might be injured exhibit a special structure. We know a priori that catastrophes are not only bad, but that agents need not ever get near to a catastrophe state. In this paper, we exploit this structure to learn a reward-shaping that accelerates learning and guards oscillating policies against repeated catastrophes. First, we demonstrate unacceptable performance of DQNs on two toy problems. We then introduce intrinsic fear, a new method that mitigates these problems by avoiding dangerous states. Our approach incorporates a second model trained via supervised learning to predict the probability of catastrophe within a short number of steps. This score then acts to penalize the Q-learning objective, shaping the reward function away from catastrophic states.","zlipton@cs.ucsd.edu, jfgao@microsoft.com, lihongli.cs@gmail.com, jianshuc@microsoft.com, deng@microsoft.com","Zachary C.

We show that a heuristic called minimum information constraint that has been shown to mitigate this effect in VAEs can also be applied to improve unsupervised clustering performance with our model. Furthermore we analyse the effect of this heuristic and provide an intuition of the various processes with the help of visualizations.

"To enhance developer productivity, all modern integrated development environments (IDEs) include code suggestion functionality that proposes likely next tokens at the cursor. While current IDEs work well for statically-typed languages, their reliance on type annotations means that they do not provide the same level of support for dynamic programming languages as for statically-typed languages. Moreover, suggestion engines in modern IDEs do not propose expressions or multi-statement idiomatic code. Recent work has shown that language models can improve code suggestion systems by learning from software repositories. This paper introduces a neural language model with a sparse pointer network aimed at capturing very long range dependencies. We release a large-scale code suggestion corpus of 41M lines of Python code crawled from GitHub. On this corpus, we found standard neural language models to perform well at suggesting local phenomena, but struggle to refer to identifiers that are introduced many tokens in the past. By augmenting a neural language model with a pointer network specialized in referring to predefined classes of identifiers, we obtain a much lower perplexity and a 5 percentage points increase in accuracy for code suggestion compared to an LSTM baseline. In fact, this increase in code suggestion accuracy is due to a 13 times more accurate prediction of identifiers. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis shows this model indeed captures interesting long-range dependencies, like referring to a class member defined over 60 tokens in the past.","avishkar.bhoopchand.15@ucl.ac.uk, t.rocktaschel@cs.ucl.ac.uk, e.barr@cs.ucl.ac.uk, s.riedel@cs.ucl.ac.uk","Avishkar Bhoopchand, Tim Rocktäschel, Earl Barr, Sebastian Riedel","cs.ucl.ac.uk, ucl.ac.uk, google.com, informatik.hu-berlin.de, cs.umass.edu, ed.ac.uk",,r1kQkVFgl,bhoopchand|learning_python_code_suggestion_with_a_sparse_pointer_network,Learning Python Code Suggestion with a Sparse Pointer Network,We augment a neural language model with a pointer network for code suggestion that is specialized to referring to predefined groups of identifiers,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl&noteId=r1kQkVFgl,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1kQkVFgl
"We provide a theoretical explanation for the superb performance of ResNet via the study of deep linear networks and some nonlinear variants. We show that with or without nonlinearities, by adding shortcuts that have depth two, the condition number of the Hessian of the loss function at the zero initial point is depth-invariant, which makes training very deep models no more difficult than shallow ones. Shortcuts of higher depth result in an extremely flat (high-order) stationary point initially, from which the optimization algorithm is hard to escape. The 1-shortcut, however, is essentially equivalent to no shortcuts. Extensive experiments are provided accompanying our theoretical results. We show that initializing the network to small weights with 2-shortcuts achieves significantly better results than random Gaussian (Xavier) initialization, orthogonal initialization, and shortcuts of deeper depth, from various perspectives ranging from final loss, learning dynamics and stability, to the behavior of the Hessian along the learning process.","lisihan13@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, jiantao@stanford.edu, yjhan@stanford.edu, tsachy@stanford.edu","Sihan Li, Jiantao Jiao, Yanjun Han, Tsachy Weissman","mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, mail.tsinghua.edu.cn, tsinghua.edu.cn, stanford.edu, harvard.edu","Deep learning, Optimization, Theory",SJAr0QFxe,li|demystifying_resnet,Demystifying ResNet,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe&noteId=SJAr0QFxe,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJAr0QFxe
"We introduce similarity encoders (SimEc), which learn similarity preserving representations by using a feed-forward neural network to map data into an embedding space where the original similarities can be approximated linearly. The model can easily compute representations for novel (out-of-sample) data points, even if the original pairwise similarities of the training set were generated by an unknown process such as human ratings. This is demonstrated by creating embeddings of both image and text data.
Furthermore, the idea behind similarity encoders gives an intuitive explanation of the optimization strategy used by the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) word2vec model trained with negative sampling. Based on this insight, we define context encoders (ConEc), which can improve the word embeddings created with word2vec by using the local context of words to create out-of-vocabulary embeddings and representations for words with multiple meanings. The benefit of this is illustrated by using these word embeddings as features in the CoNLL 2003 named entity recognition task.","franziska.horn@campus.tu-berlin.de, klaus-robert.mueller@tu-berlin.de","Franziska Horn, Klaus-Robert Müller",tu-berlin.de,"Natural language processing, Unsupervised Learning, Supervised Learning",SkBsEQYll,horn|learning_similarity_preserving_representations_with_neural_similarity_and_context_encoders,Learning similarity preserving representations with neural similarity and context encoders,Neural network way of doing kernel PCA and an extension of word2vec to compute out-of-vocabulary embeddings and distinguish between multiple meanings of a word based on its local context.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll&noteId=SkBsEQYll,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SkBsEQYll

"Domain adaptation is crucial in many real-world applications where the distribution of the training data differs from the distribution of the test data. Previous Deep Learning-based approaches to domain adaptation need to be trained jointly on source and target domain data and are therefore unappealing in scenarios where models need to be adapted to a large number of domains or where a domain is evolving, e.g. spam detection where attackers continuously change their tactics.

To fill this gap, we propose Knowledge Adaptation, an extension of Knowledge Distillation (Bucilua et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015) to the domain adaptation scenario. We show how a student model achieves state-of-the-art results on unsupervised domain adaptation from multiple sources on a standard sentiment analysis benchmark by taking into account the domain-specific expertise of multiple teachers and the similarities between their domains.

When learning from a single teacher, using domain similarity to gauge trustworthiness is inadequate. To this end, we propose a simple metric that correlates well with the teacher's accuracy in the target domain. We demonstrate that incorporating high-confidence examples selected by this metric enables the student model to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the single-source scenario.","sebastian.ruder@insight-centre.org, parsa@aylien.com, john.breslin@insight-centre.org","Sebastian Ruder, Parsa Ghaffari, John G.

"Increasingly, practitioners apply neural networks to complex

  parsing, that have rich output structures. Many such applications
  require deterministic constraints on the output values; for example,
  requiring that the sequential outputs encode a valid tree. While
  hidden units might capture such properties, the network is not
  always able to learn them from the training data alone, and
  practitioners must then resort to post-processing. In this paper, we
  present an inference method for neural networks that enforces
  deterministic constraints on outputs without performing
  post-processing or expensive discrete search over the feasible
  space. Instead, for each input, we nudge the continuous weights

"We introduce the hierarchical compositional network (HCN), a directed generative model able to discover and disentangle, without supervision, the building blocks of a set of binary images. The building blocks are binary features defined hierarchically as a composition of some of the features in the layer immediately below, arranged in a particular manner. At a high level, HCN is similar to a sigmoid belief network with pooling. Inference and learning in HCN are very challenging and existing variational approximations do not work satisfactorily. A main contribution of this work is to show that both can be addressed using max-product message passing (MPMP) with a particular schedule (no EM required). Also, using MPMP as an inference engine for HCN makes new tasks simple: adding supervision information, classifying images, or performing inpainting all correspond to clamping some variables of the model to their known values and running MPMP on the rest. When used for classification, fast inference with HCN has exactly the same functional form as a convolutional neural network (CNN) with linear activations and binary weights. However, HCN’s features are qualitatively very different.","miguel@vicarious.com, yi@vicarious.com, scott@vicarious.com, dileep@vicarious.com","Miguel Lazaro-Gredilla, Yi Liu, D.

"Humans perceive their surroundings in great detail even though most of our visual field is reduced to low-fidelity color-deprived (e.g., dichromatic) input by the retina. In contrast, most deep learning architectures deploy computational resources homogeneously to every part of the visual input. Is such a prodigal deployment of resources necessary? In this paper, we present a framework for investigating the extent to which connectionist architectures can perceive an image in full detail even when presented with low acuity, distorted input. Our goal is to initiate investigations that will be fruitful both for engineering better networks and also for eventually testing hypotheses on the neural mechanisms responsible for our own visual system's ability to perceive missing information. We find that networks can compensate for low acuity input by learning global feature functions that allow the network to fill in some of the missing details. For example, the networks accurately perceive shape and color in the periphery, even when 75\% of the input is achromatic and low resolution. On the other hand, the network is prone to similar mistakes as humans; for example, when presented with a fully grayscale landscape image, it perceives the sky as blue when the sky is actually a red sunset.","fwick@cs.umb.edu, mwick@cs.umass.edu, mpomplun@gmail.com","Farahnaz A.

"The size of neural network models that deal with sparse inputs and outputs is often dominated by the dimensionality of those inputs and outputs. Large models with high-dimensional inputs and outputs are difficult to train due to the limited memory of graphical processing units, and difficult to deploy on mobile devices with limited hardware. To address these difficulties, we propose Bloom embeddings, a compression technique that can be applied to the input and output of neural network models dealing with sparse high-dimensional binary-coded instances. Bloom embeddings are computationally efficient, and do not seriously compromise the accuracy of the model up to 1/5 compression ratios.

"Reinforcement learning is concerned with learning to interact with environments that are initially unknown. State-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches, such as DQN, are model-free and learn to act effectively across a wide range of environments such as Atari games, but require huge amounts of data. Model-based techniques are more data-efficient, but need to acquire explicit knowledge about the environment dynamics or the reward structure. 

In this paper we take a step towards using model-based techniques in environments with high-dimensional visual state space when system dynamics and the reward structure are both unknown and need to be learned, by demonstrating that it is possible to learn both jointly.
Empirical evaluation on five Atari games demonstrate accurate cumulative reward prediction of up to 200 frames. We consider these positive results as opening up important directions for model-based RL in complex, initially unknown environments.","felix.leibfried@gmail.com, nkushman@microsoft.com, katja.hofmann@microsoft.com","Felix Leibfried, Nate Kushman, Katja Hofmann","mpg.de, microsoft.com",,BJxhLAuxg,leibfried|a_deep_learning_approach_for_joint_video_frame_and_reward_prediction_in_atari_games,A Deep Learning Approach for Joint Video Frame and Reward Prediction in Atari Games,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg&noteId=BJxhLAuxg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJxhLAuxg
"Most of the pedestrian detection methods are based on hand-crafted features which produce low accuracy on complex scenes. With the development of deep learning method, pedestrian detection has achieved great success. In this paper, we take advantage of a convolutional neural network which is based on Fast R-CNN framework to extract robust pedestrian features for efficient and effective pedestrian detection in complicated environments. We use the EdgeBoxes algorithm to generate effective region proposals from an image, as the quality of extracted region proposals can greatly affect the detection performance. In order to reduce the training time and to improve the generalization performance, we add a batch normalization layer between the convolutional layer and the activation function layer.

"Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which updates the model parameters by adding a local gradient times a learning rate at each step, is widely used in model training of machine learning algorithms such as neural networks. It is observed that the models trained by SGD are sensitive to learning rates and good learning rates are problem specific. To avoid manually searching of learning rates, which is tedious and inefficient, we propose an algorithm to automatically learn learning rates using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we train a policy network called actor to decide the learning rate at each step during training, and a value network called critic to give feedback about quality of the decision (e.g., the goodness of the learning rate outputted by the actor) that the actor made. Experiments show that our method leads to good convergence of SGD and can prevent overfitting to a certain extent, resulting in better performance than human-designed competitors.","changxu@nbjl.nankai.edu.cn, taoqin@microsoft.com, wgzwp@nbjl.nankai.edu.cn, tie-yan.liu@microsoft.com","Chang Xu, Tao Qin, Gang Wang, Tie-Yan Liu","nankai.edu.cn, microsoft.com","Deep learning, Reinforcement Learning",Sy7m72Ogg,xu|an_actorcritic_algorithm_for_learning_rate_learning,An Actor-critic Algorithm for Learning Rate Learning,We propose an algorithm to automatically learn learning rates using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy7m72Ogg&noteId=Sy7m72Ogg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy7m72Ogg
"Learning rich and diverse feature representation are always desired for deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Besides, when auxiliary annotations are available for specific data, simply ignoring them would be a great waste. In this paper, we incorporate these auxiliary annotations as privileged information and propose a novel CNN  model that is able to maximize inherent diversity of a CNN model such that the model can learn better feature representation with a stronger generalization ability. More specifically, we propose a group orthogonal convolutional neural network (GoCNN) to learn features from foreground and background in an orthogonal way by exploiting privileged information for optimization, which automatically emphasizes feature diversity within a single model. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, ImageNet and PASCAL VOC, well demonstrate the effectiveness and high generalization ability of our proposed GoCNN models.","chenyunpeng@u.nus.edu, xiaojie.jin@u.nus.edu, elefjia@nus.edu.sg, yanshuicheng@360.cn","Yunpeng Chen, Xiaojie Jin, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan","u.nus.edu, nus.edu.sg, 360.cn","Deep learning, Computer vision, Supervised Learning",ByQPVFull,chen|training_group_orthogonal_neural_networks_with_privileged_information,Training Group Orthogonal Neural Networks with Privileged Information,A convolutional neural network for image classification which encourages learning more diverse feature representations by using image segmentations as privileged information.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull&noteId=ByQPVFull,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ByQPVFull
We propose a novel attention model which can accurately attend to target objects of various scales and shapes in images. The model is trained to gradually suppress irrelevant regions in an input image via a progressive attentive process over multiple layers of a convolutional neural network. The attentive process in each layer determines whether to pass or suppress features at certain spatial locations for use in the next layer. We further employ local contexts to estimate attention probability at each location since it is difficult to infer accurate attention by observing a feature vector from a single location only. The experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed attention network outperforms traditional attention methods in visual attribute prediction tasks.,"hsseo@postech.ac.kr, zlin@adobe.com, scohen@adobe.com, xshen@adobe.com, bhhan@postech.ac.kr","Paul Hongsuck Seo, Zhe Lin, Scott Cohen, Xiaohui Shen, Bohyung Han","postech.ac.kr, adobe.com","Deep learning, Computer vision, Multi-modal learning",HyEeMu_xx,seo|progressive_attention_networks_for_visual_attribute_prediction,Progressive Attention Networks for Visual Attribute Prediction,Progressive attention model that accurately attends to the target objects of various scales and shapes through multiple CNN layers.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyEeMu_xx&noteId=HyEeMu_xx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HyEeMu_xx
"Current language models have significant limitations in their ability to encode and decode knowledge. This is mainly because they acquire knowledge based on statistical co-occurrences, even if most of the knowledge words are rarely observed named entities. In this paper, we propose a Neural Knowledge Language Model (NKLM) which combines symbolic knowledge provided by a knowledge graph with the RNN language model. At each time step, the model predicts a fact on which the observed word is to be based. Then, a word is either generated from the vocabulary or copied from the knowledge graph. We train and test the model on a new dataset, WikiFacts. In experiments, we show that the NKLM significantly improves the perplexity while generating a much smaller number of unknown words. In addition, we demonstrate that the sampled descriptions include named entities which were used to be the unknown words in RNN language models.","sjn.ahn@gmail.com, heeyoul@gmail.com, tanel.parnamaa@gmail.com, yoshua.bengio@umontreal.ca","Sungjin Ahn, Heeyoul Choi, Tanel Parnamaa, Yoshua Bengio","umontreal.ca, iro.umontreal.ca, samsung.com","Natural language processing, Deep learning",BJwFrvOeg,ahn|a_neural_knowledge_language_model,A Neural Knowledge Language Model,"A neural recurrent language model which can extract knowledge from a knowledge base to generate knowledge related words such as person names, locations, years, etc.",Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJwFrvOeg&noteId=BJwFrvOeg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJwFrvOeg
"A synonym of a polysemous word is usually only the paraphrase of one sense among many. When lexicons are used to improve vector-space word representations, such paraphrases are unreliable and bring noise to the vector-space. The prior works use a coefficient to adjust the overall learning of the lexicons. They regard the paraphrases equally. 
In this paper, we propose a novel approach that regards the paraphrases diversely to alleviate the adverse effects of polysemy. We annotate each paraphrase with a degree of reliability. The paraphrases are randomly eliminated according to the degrees when our model learns word representations. In this way, our approach drops the unreliable paraphrases, keeping more reliable paraphrases at the same time. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the word vectors.
Our approach is an attempt to address the polysemy problem keeping one vector per word. It makes the approach easier to use than the conventional methods that estimate multiple vectors for a word.

"Previous work has shown that feature maps of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
can be interpreted as feature representation of a particular image region. Features aggregated from
these feature maps have been exploited for image retrieval tasks and achieved state-of-the-art performances in
recent years. The key to the success of such methods is the feature representation. However, the different
factors that impact the effectiveness of features are still not explored thoroughly. There are much less
discussion about the best combination of them.

The main contribution of our paper is the thorough evaluations of the various factors that affect the
discriminative ability of the features extracted from CNNs. Based on the evaluation results, we also identify

"Biclustering is evolving into one of the major tools for analyzing large datasets given as matrix of samples times features. Biclustering has several noteworthy applications and has been successfully applied in life sciences and e-commerce for drug design and recommender systems, respectively.

FABIA is one of the most successful biclustering methods and is used by companies like Bayer, Janssen, or Zalando. FABIA is a generative model that represents each bicluster by two sparse membership vectors: one for the samples and one for the features. However, FABIA is restricted to about 20 code units because of the high computational complexity of computing the posterior. Furthermore, code units are sometimes insufficiently decorrelated. Sample membership is difficult to determine because vectors do not have exact zero entries and can have both large positive and large negative values.

We propose to use the recently introduced unsupervised Deep Learning approach Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs) to overcome the drawbacks of existing biclustering methods. RFNs efficiently construct very sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input via their posterior means. RFN learning is a generalized alternating minimization algorithm based on the posterior regularization method which enforces non-negative and normalized posterior means. Each code unit represents a bicluster, where samples for which the code unit is active belong to the bicluster and features that have activating weights to the code unit belong to the bicluster.

On 400 benchmark datasets with artificially implanted biclusters, RFN significantly outperformed 13 other biclustering competitors including FABIA. In biclustering experiments on three gene expression datasets with known clusters that were determined by separate measurements, RFN biclustering was two times significantly better than the other 13 methods and once on second place. On data of the 1000 Genomes Project, RFN could identify DNA segments which indicate, that interbreeding with other hominins starting already before ancestors of modern humans left Africa.","okko@bioinf.jku.at, unterthiner@bioinf.jku.at, hochreit@bioinf.jku.at","Djork-Arné Clevert, Thomas Unterthiner, Sepp Hochreiter",jku.at,"Deep learning, Unsupervised Learning, Applications",ryb-q1Olg,clevert|rectified_factor_networks_for_biclustering,Rectified Factor Networks for Biclustering,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryb-q1Olg&noteId=ryb-q1Olg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryb-q1Olg

"Latent representation learned from multi-layered neural networks via hierarchical feature abstraction enables recent success of deep learning. Under the deep learning framework, generalization performance highly depends on the learned latent representation. In this work, we propose a novel latent space modeling method to learn better latent representation. We designed a neural network model based on the assumption that good base representation for supervised tasks can be attained by maximizing the sum of hierarchical mutual informations between the input, latent, and output variables. From this base model, we introduce a semantic noise modeling method which enables semantic perturbation on the latent space to enhance the representational power of learned latent feature. During training, latent vector representation can be stochastically perturbed by a modeled additive noise while preserving its original semantics. It implicitly brings the effect of semantic augmentation on the latent space. The proposed model can be easily learned by back-propagation with common gradient-based optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed method helps to achieve performance benefits against various previous approaches. We also provide the empirical analyses for the proposed latent space modeling method including t-SNE visualization.","hekim@lunit.io, shwang@lunit.io, kyunghyun.cho@nyu.edu","Hyo-Eun Kim, Sangheum Hwang, Kyunghyun Cho","lunit.io, kaist.ac.kr, samsung.com, nyu.edu, umontreal.ca","Deep learning, Supervised Learning",SyCSsUDee,kim|semantic_noise_modeling_for_better_representation_learning,Semantic Noise Modeling for Better Representation Learning,A novel latent space modeling method to learn better representation,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee&noteId=SyCSsUDee,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyCSsUDee
"This paper aims to reduce test-time computational load of a deep neural network. Unlike previous methods which factorize a weight matrix into multiple real-valued matrices, our method factorizes both weights and activations into integer and noninteger components. In our method, the real-valued weight matrix is approximated by a multiplication of a ternary matrix and a real-valued co-efficient matrix. Since the ternary matrix consists of three integer values, {-1, 0, +1}, it only consumes 2 bits per element. At test-time, an activation vector that passed from a previous layer is also transformed into a weighted sum of binary vectors, {-1, +1}, which enables fast feed-forward propagation based on simple logical operations: AND, XOR, and bit count. This makes it easier to deploy a deep network on low-power CPUs or to design specialized hardware.
In our experiments, we tested our method on three different networks: a CNN for handwritten digits, VGG-16 model for ImageNet classification, and VGG-Face for large-scale face recognition. In particular, when we applied our method to three fully connected layers in the VGG-16, 15x acceleration and memory compression up to 5.2% were achieved with only a 1.43% increase in the top-5 error. Our experiments also revealed that compressing convolutional layers can accelerate inference of the entire network in exchange of slight increase in error.","manbai@d-itlab.co.jp, tmatsumoto@d-itlab.co.jp, yamashita@cs.chubu.ac.jp, hf@cs.chubu.ac.jp","Mitsuru Ambai, Takuya Matsumoto, Takayoshi Yamashita, Hironobu Fujiyoshi","chubu.ac.jp, d-itlab.co.jp, denso.co.jp, kumamoto-u.ac.jp",Deep learning,ByOK0rwlx,ambai|ternary_weight_decomposition_and_binary_activation_encoding_for_fast_and_compact_neural_network,Ternary Weight Decomposition and Binary Activation Encoding for Fast and Compact Neural Network,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByOK0rwlx&noteId=ByOK0rwlx,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ByOK0rwlx
Classical translation models constrain the space of possible outputs by selecting a subset of translation rules based on the input sentence. Recent work on improving the efficiency of neural translation models adopted a similar strategy by restricting the output vocabulary to a subset of likely candidates given the source. In this paper we experiment with context and embedding-based selection methods and extend previous work by examining speed and accuracy trade-offs in more detail. We show that decoding time on CPUs can be reduced by up to 90% and training time by 25% on the WMT15 English-German and WMT16 English-Romanian tasks at the same or only negligible change in accuracy.

"We consider the problem of how to reduce the cost of communication that is re- quired for the parallel training of a neural network. The state-of-the-art method, Bulk Synchronous Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent (BSP-SGD), requires a many collective communication operations, like broadcasts of parameters or reduc- tions for sub-gradient aggregations, which for large messages quickly dominates overall execution time and limits parallel scalability. To address this problem, we develop a new technique for collective operations, referred to as Linear Pipelining (LP). It is tuned to the message sizes that arise in BSP-SGD, and works effectively on multi-GPU systems. Theoretically, the cost of LP is invariant to P , where P is the number of GPUs, while the cost of more conventional Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) scales like O(log P ). LP also demonstrate up to 2x faster bandwidth than Bidirectional Exchange (BE) techniques that are widely adopted by current MPI implementations. We apply these collectives to BSP-SGD, showing that the proposed implementations reduce communication bottlenecks in practice while preserving the attractive convergence properties of BSP-SGD.","linnan.wang@gatech.edu, wwu12@vols.utk.edu, bosilca@icl.utk.edu, richie@cc.gatech.edu, zlxu@uestc.edu.cn","Linnan Wang, Wei Wu, George Bosilca, Richard Vuduc, Zenglin Xu","cs.cmu.edu, microsoft.com, gatech.edu, utk.edu","Applications, Deep learning",HkzuKpLgg,wang|efficient_communications_in_training_large_scale_neural_networks,Efficient Communications in Training Large Scale Neural Networks,Tackle the communications in the parallel training of neural networks,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg&noteId=HkzuKpLgg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HkzuKpLgg

We propose a simple but effective neural net approach, the Semantic Embedding Model (SEM), that models the labels for an instance as draws from a multinomial distribution parametrized by nonlinear functions of the instance features. A Gauss-Siedel mini-batch adaptive gradient descent algorithm is used to fit the model. To handle extremely large label sets, we propose and experimentally validate the efficacy of fitting randomly chosen marginal label distributions. Experimental results on eight real-world data sets show that SEM garners significant performance gains over existing methods. In particular, we compare SEM to four recent state-of-the-art algorithms (NNML, BMLPL, REmbed, and SLEEC) and find that SEM uniformly outperforms these algorithms in several widely used evaluation metrics while requiring significantly less training time.","lpjing@bjtu.edu.cn, 15112085@bjtu.edu.cn, 11112191@bjtu.edu.cn, gittens@icsi.berkeley.edu, mmahoney@stat.berkeley.edu","Liping Jing, MiaoMiao Cheng, Liu Yang, Alex Gittens, Michael W.

"The extraction of useful deep features is important for many computer vision tasks.
Deep features extracted from classification networks have proved to perform well in those tasks.
To obtain features of greater usefulness, end-to-end distance metric learning (DML) has been applied to train the feature extractor directly.
End-to-end DML approaches such as Magnet Loss and lifted structured feature embedding show state-of-the-art performance in several image recognition tasks.
However, in these DML studies, there were no equitable comparisons between features extracted from a DML-based network and those from a softmax-based network.
In this paper, by presenting objective comparisons between these two approaches under the same network architecture, we show that the softmax-based features are markedly better than the state-of-the-art DML features for tasks such as fine-grained recognition, attribute estimation, clustering, and retrieval.","horiguchi@hal.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp, ikami@hal.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp, aizawa@hal.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp","Shota Horiguchi, Daiki Ikami, Kiyoharu Aizawa",t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Computer vision, Deep learning",HyQWFOVge,horiguchi|significance_of_softmaxbased_features_over_metric_learningbased_features,Significance of Softmax-Based Features over Metric Learning-Based Features,We show softmax-based features are markedly better than state-of-the-art metric learning-based features by conducting fair comparison between them.,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge&noteId=HyQWFOVge,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HyQWFOVge
"We focus on generative autoencoders, such as variational or adversarial autoencoders, which jointly learn a generative model alongside an inference model. Generative autoencoders are those which are trained to softly enforce a prior on the latent distribution learned by the inference model. We call the distribution to which the inference model maps observed samples, the learned latent distribution, which may not be consistent with the prior. We formulate a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling process, equivalent to iteratively decoding and encoding, which allows us to sample from the learned latent distribution. Since, the generative model learns to map from the learned latent distribution, rather than the prior, we may use MCMC to improve the quality of samples drawn from the generative model, especially when the learned latent distribution is far from the prior. Using MCMC sampling, we are able to reveal previously unseen differences between generative autoencoders trained either with or without a denoising criterion.","ac2211@imperial.ac.uk, ka709@imperial.ac.uk, aab01@imperial.ac.uk","Antonia Creswell, Kai Arulkumaran, Anil Anthony Bharath",imperial.ac.uk,"Deep learning, Unsupervised Learning, Theory",ryXZmzNeg,creswell|improving_sampling_from_generative_autoencoders_with_markov_chains,Improving Sampling from Generative Autoencoders with Markov Chains,Iteratively encoding and decoding samples from generative autoencoders recovers samples from the true latent distribution learned by the model,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryXZmzNeg&noteId=ryXZmzNeg,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryXZmzNeg
"We ask whether neural networks can learn to use secret keys to protect
information from other neural networks.  Specifically, we focus on
ensuring confidentiality properties in a multiagent system, and we
specify those properties in terms of an adversary.  Thus, a
system may consist of neural networks named Alice and Bob, and we aim
to limit what a third neural network named Eve learns from
eavesdropping on the communication between Alice and Bob.
We do not prescribe specific cryptographic algorithms to these neural networks;
instead, we train end-to-end, adversarially.
We demonstrate that the neural networks can learn 
how to perform forms of encryption and decryption, and also
how to apply these operations selectively in order to meet
confidentiality goals.","abadi@google.com, dga@google.com","Martín Abadi, David G.

"Convolutional networks have marked their place over the last few years as the
best performing model for various visual tasks. They are, however, most suited
for supervised learning from large amounts of labeled data. Previous attempts
have been made to use unlabeled data to improve model performance by applying
unsupervised techniques. These attempts require different architectures and training methods.
In this work we present a novel approach for unsupervised training
of Convolutional networks that is based on contrasting between spatial regions
within images.  This criterion can be employed within conventional neural net-
works and trained using standard techniques such as SGD and back-propagation,
thus complementing supervised methods.","ehoffer@tx.technion.ac.il, itayh@tx.technion.ac.il, nailon@cs.technion.ac.il","Elad Hoffer, Itay Hubara, Nir Ailon","technion.ac.il, intel.com","Unsupervised Learning, Deep learning, Computer vision",S1vyujVye,hoffer|deep_unsupervised_learning_through_spatial_contrasting,Deep unsupervised learning through spatial contrasting,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye&noteId=S1vyujVye,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1vyujVye
"Deep neural networks are learning models with a very high capacity and therefore prone to over-fitting. Many regularization techniques such as Dropout, DropConnect, and weight decay all attempt to solve the problem of over-fitting by reducing the capacity of their respective models (Srivastava et al., 2014), (Wan et al., 2013), (Krogh & Hertz, 1992). In this paper we introduce a new form of regularization that guides the learning problem in a way that reduces over-fitting without sacrificing the capacity of the model. The mistakes that models make in early stages of training carry information about the learning problem. By adjusting the labels of the current epoch of training through a weighted average of the real labels, and an exponential average of the past soft-targets we achieved a regularization scheme as powerful as Dropout without necessarily reducing the capacity of the model, and simplified the complexity of the learning problem. SoftTarget regularization proved to be an effective tool in various neural network architectures.",armen.ag@live.com,Armen Aghajanyan,dimensionalmechanics.com,"Deep learning, Optimization, Computer vision",BkCPyXm1l,aghajanyan|softtarget_regularization_an_effective_technique_to_reduce_overfitting_in_neural_networks,SoftTarget Regularization: An Effective Technique to Reduce Over-Fitting in Neural Networks,,Reject,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l&noteId=BkCPyXm1l,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BkCPyXm1l
"Recurrent neural nets are widely used for predicting temporal data. Their inherent deep feedforward structure allows learning complex sequential patterns. It is believed that top-down feedback might be an important missing ingredient which in theory could help disambiguate similar patterns depending on broader context. In this paper, we introduce surprisal-driven recurrent networks, which take into account past error information when making new predictions. This is achieved by continuously monitoring the discrepancy between most recent predictions and the actual observations. Furthermore, we show that it outperforms other stochastic and fully deterministic approaches on enwik8 character level prediction task achieving 1.37 BPC.",kmrocki@us.ibm.com,Kamil Rocki,ibm.com,"Unsupervised Learning, Applications, Deep learning",S1J0E-71l,rocki|surprisaldriven_feedback_in_recurrent_networks,Surprisal-Driven Feedback in Recurrent Networks,"In this paper, we add surprisal as additional input to RNN , which take into account past error information when making new predictions.
